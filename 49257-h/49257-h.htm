<h2><i>Foreword</i></h2>


<p>The present book completes the trilogy on the lives of the
Founders of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith. However, now that additional
material is at my disposal, it is my hope to expand at a future
date the volume on the life of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, and also to write
a supplement to the volume on the life of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;.</p>

<p>This book is the first in the range of Bah&aacute;'&iacute; literature to
make extensive use of official documents from governmental
archives. I am greatly indebted to Moojan Momen who has
generously shared with me the results of his able research
in the Public Record Office of London and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The two British Foreign Secretaries who received news
and dispatches regarding the B&aacute;b and the B&aacute;b&iacute;s were the
Earl of Aberdeen, who held office from September 1841 to
July 1846, under Sir Robert Peel; and Viscount Palmerston,
whose tenure of office extended from July 1846 to January
1852, under Lord John Russell. The British envoy chiefly
involved in forwarding such reports to London was Lt.-Col.
(later Sir Justin) Sheil, the Minister in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. Lord Palmerston's
letters to him (F.O. 248/134) state that his dispatches
concerning the B&aacute;b and the B&aacute;b&iacute;s were 'laid before the
Queen'.</p>

<p>My deep gratitude goes to Abul-Qasim Afnan, who has
unstintingly made available to me the chronicle-history and
the autobiography of his father, the late &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h,
as well as letters written by and to the relatives of the
B&aacute;b, together with many other documents of inestimable
value.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that apart from quotations
from the Writings of the B&aacute;b, speeches attributed to Him or
to anyone else in these pages must not be taken as exact
reportage of words spoken at the time. They only convey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
the sense and purport of what was said on those occasions.
Obviously no one was taking notes. It is possible, however,
that a few short sentences here and there, which immediately
engrave themselves on the mind, are exact utterances, the
very words spoken.</p>

<p>As the bibliography indicates I have consulted a number
of books; but of printed works, the main sources have been
<i>God Passes By</i> and Nab&iacute;l's Narrative, <i>The Dawn-Breakers</i>. I am
much indebted to the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Publishing Trust, Wilmette, Illinois,
for permission to quote from these and other sources,
as well as to Cambridge University Press, the Public Record
Office, George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., A. &amp; C. Black Ltd.,
Faber &amp; Faber Ltd., William Heinemann Ltd., Methuen &amp;
Co. Ltd., and <i>World Order</i>, A Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Magazine. Full acknowledgment
is made in the bibliography and notes.</p>

<p>I am profoundly grateful to the Hands of the Cause Paul
Haney and Abul-Qasim Faizi for reading the manuscript
and for their review and advice. As in the past Marion
Hofman's generous help has smoothed the path to publication.
My indebtedness to her is immense. And without
my wife's assistance and support I could not have completed
my task.</p>

<p>I should also like to thank Miss Dorothy Wigington,
Mr. Farhang Afnan and Mr. Rustom Sabit for their care
in reading the proofs, and Mr. Horst W. Kolodziej for his
excellent reproduction of a number of old documents and
photographs.</p>

<p>Finally, a word as to the Prologue; this in my view provides
a necessary background for the story of the B&aacute;b. But
should the reader find in it too many unfamiliar facts, he
may turn immediately to the first chapter.</p>

<h2><i>A Note on the Construction of Persian Names</i></h2>


<p>In times past the people of Persia had no surnames, but in
many instances they were known by the name of the district,
city, town, or even the village from which they came: for
example, <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n&iacute;, M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n&iacute;, &#7788;ihr&aacute;n&iacute;, I&#7779;fah&aacute;n&iacute;, and
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z&iacute;.</p>

<p>There were also various honorific prefixes and suffixes
by which a person was distinguished. A descendant of the
Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad had (and has) the prefix of 'Siyyid'. At
times, 'M&iacute;rz&aacute;' took the place of 'Siyyid', and at times the
two were used together. 'M&iacute;rz&aacute;' by itself did not denote
any particular ancestry, except when placed after a proper
name to mark royal descent.</p>

<p>The suffix '<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n' served at one time as a title, but with
passing years, it became merely honorific, even meaningless,
and at no time was it a surname.</p>

<p>The prefix '&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;' or '&#7716;&aacute;j' indicated then, as now, one who
had made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had&iacute; and Karbil&aacute;'&iacute;,
as prefixes, marked pilgrimage to Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had or Karbil&aacute;, but
as suffixes pointed out nativity.</p>

<p>There were also innumerable titles conferred by the
sovereign in &Iacute;r&aacute;n, consisting of diverse combinations, sometimes
ludicrous, sometimes grammatically impossible. Occasionally
they indicated a definite rank and profession. As
time passed, these titles multiplied absurdly, until they were
swept away by legislation in the 1920's.</p>

<p>Finally, a person was often distinguished from others by a
combination of prefixes and suffixes attached to his name
which, if omitted, might cause him to be taken for another
person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Today the situation is much changed, but for the period
described in this book, the author can identify people
only by the names they then used, however difficult they
may be.</p>

<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>About the time that the thirteen colonies of North America
were gaining their independence to form the nucleus of the
mighty Republic of the West, France was inching her way
towards a revolution such as the world had never seen,
and Britain was striding along the road to a revolution of a
different kind, industrial, agrarian and economic in nature,
a cleric of the Islamic <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah persuasion left his island-home
in the Persian Gulf for the great centres of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah
learning and <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah devotion in `Ir&aacute;q. His purpose was
to find a much larger audience in order to give voice to
thoughts and presentiments that had developed with his
years.</p>

<p><span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad-i-A&#7717;s&aacute;'&iacute; (1743-1826), the founder of the
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute; school, belonged to the ancient tribe of Ban&uacute;-&#7778;a<span class="u">kh</span>r,
and his family originated from the region of A&#7717;s&aacute; on the
Arabian mainland. His father's name was <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Zayni'd-D&iacute;n,
and Ba&#7717;rayn had been their home. <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad
first visited Najaf, where the Tomb of `Al&iacute;, the first Im&aacute;m,
cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad, is
situated. Then in Karbil&aacute;, close by the Shrine of the martyred
&#7716;usayn, the third Im&aacute;m, he began to preach and a
circle of earnest students gathered round him. He asked the
leading <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah divines of the holy cities of `Ir&aacute;q to issue him
a licence which would give him recognition as a mujtahid
in his own right, that is, a divine empowered to interpret
and prescribe. They all declared that they considered
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad to be a man of knowledge and talent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
superior to their own, and that their testimonial was written
solely at his request.</p>

<p>The fame of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad soon spread throughout
&Iacute;r&aacute;n. Fat&#7717;-`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h (reigned 1797-1834) and Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute;,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> a son of the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h who held the life-long tenure
of the governorship of Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h, were particularly
desirous to meet him. But <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad preferred to go
to &Iacute;r&aacute;n by way of B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr (Bushire) in the south, rather than
by the nearer and more accessible route of Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h in
the west. From B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr he went to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z and thence to
Yazd, where he stayed for a number of years. Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;,
a young man barely out of his teens, who shared the
same views, joined him there (sometime in 1231 A.H.:
1815-16). <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad was then making his final arrangements
to go on pilgrimage to the holy city of Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
prior to his visit to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. He received Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im with
great affection and asked him to remain at Yazd to take up
his own patient work of many years. In Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had and later
in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad was shown every mark of high
respect and reverence.</p>

<p>Eventually Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im travelled north to be in his
company, and together they went to Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h, as the
Prince-Governor had been urgently begging his father to
let <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad visit him. They stayed in Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h as
long as the Governor lived. After his premature death, they
departed for Karbil&aacute;, where <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad, his zeal unabated
and his powers untouched by advancing years,
preached and taught. He was in his early eighties when he
took the road to Mecca and Medina. From that journey he
did not return and lies buried in the famed cemetery of
Baqi`, in the vicinity of the Tomb of the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad.</p>

<p><span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad's constant theme was the near advent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the Deliverer of the Latter Days, promised to the world of
Isl&aacute;m, the Q&aacute;'im of the House of Mu&#7717;ammad or the Mihd&iacute;
(Mahd&iacute;).<a name="Nanchor_P1" id="Nanchor_P1"></a><a href="#Note_P1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In the course of his last pilgrimage to the holy
cities of Arabia, he told a merchant from I&#7779;fah&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> who was
with him: 'You will attain the presence of the B&aacute;b; salute
Him on my behalf.'<a name="Nanchor_P2" id="Nanchor_P2"></a><a href="#Note_P2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad did not believe in
physical resurrection nor in the physical ascent (Mi`r&aacute;j)<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> of
the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad to heaven on the night that the
Angel Gabriel took Him to view the celestial world. Mi`r&aacute;j
was an experience of the spirit, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad maintained.
Moreover he asserted that the signs and portents of the
coming of the Q&aacute;'im, given by the Prophet and the Im&aacute;ms,
were allegorical. These and similar doctrines were anathema
to the orthodox, but while <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad lived, royal
patronage muted their hostile criticism.</p>

<p>Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im (1793-1843), who, in accordance with the
will of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad, succeeded him in guiding his
disciples, was the son of Siyyid Q&aacute;sim of Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t, a town in
northern &Iacute;r&aacute;n close to the Caspian Sea. He came from a
family of well-known merchants and was no more than
thirty-three years old when he occupied the seat of authority.
The orthodox divines now began their vitriolic
assaults in earnest until, at last, Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im felt that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
needed solid support in &Iacute;r&aacute;n from the ranks of the orthodox.
For that purpose he chose one of his ablest disciples, Mull&aacute;
&#7716;usayn, a native of the small town of Bu<span class="u">sh</span>r&uacute;yih in <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n,
to go to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n and secure the aid of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad-B&aacute;qir-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;,
a noted divine whose influence was felt
far and wide. Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn succeeded brilliantly in accomplishing
the mission entrusted to him, obtained the support
of that famous man in writing, and then proceeded to
Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had to acquire a similar pledge from yet another powerful
divine.</p>

<p>In the meantime not only did Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im suffer from the
intrigues and onslaughts of his adversaries headed by Siyyid
Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m-i-Qazv&iacute;n&iacute;, but the whole of Karbil&aacute; was thrown
into turmoil. These disorders were of long standing and
gradually the authority of the Ottoman government had
ceased to exist. Within the town there were several factions
at odds with one another, but all determined to resist the
re-establishment of Ottoman power. Two successive V&aacute;l&iacute;s
(governor-generals) of `Ir&aacute;q tried to force the people of
Karbil&aacute; to submission, but failed conspicuously. However,
in the closing months of the year 1842, Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;, a man
resolute and even obstinate, came to occupy the post of
V&aacute;l&iacute;. Affairs in Karbil&aacute; had gradually gone from bad to
worse. Lawlessness had increased and mob rule prevailed.
Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;'s first thought was to resolve this problem which
had baffled his predecessors. He tried to negotiate a settlement,
but neither he nor the rebels of Karbil&aacute; could really
trust one another. Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; moved near-by to Musayyib
and sent Sar`askar (Colonel) Sa`du'll&aacute;h P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; with a small
force to reduce the town. Negotiations proceeded apace.
Emissaries came and went. Persian princes, who lived in
Karbil&aacute;, took part in the negotiations, but nothing was
achieved.</p>

<p>During those fatal weeks, at the end of the year 1842 and
the beginning of 1843, Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im, who was greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
respected both for his wisdom and humanity,<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> took a leading
role, urging all parties to act with moderation and in a spirit
of conciliation. Twice, in company with a small delegation,
he visited the camps of Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; and Sa`du'll&aacute;h P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;
outside Karbil&aacute;. Lieutenant-Colonel Farrant, the British
Special Commissioner, reported his efforts to Constantinople:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">claimed the throne of &Iacute;r&aacute;n. He showed great benevolence</span><br />
towards the divines of Karbil&aacute; and Najaf, sent them money and
stood up for them. However, he was unsuccessful and betook
himself to Karbil&aacute;. There he fell on hard times and suffered
poverty. He expected the divines to come to his help and applied
to them, one by one. But none heeded him. One night he and
his family had to go to bed hungry. At midnight he heard a
knock on his door. When he opened it he found someone,
who had pulled his `ab&aacute; over his head so as to hide his face.
This man put a purse with money in it into his hands and went
away.</p>

<p>'Time passed. Indigence and want recurred. Again the same
person, head covered with `ab&aacute;, came at midnight, handed a
sum of money and went away without a word. To the repeated
question "who are you?" he gave no answer. Then, that man
came a third time with a purse containing money. This time `Al&iacute;-<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h
followed him and saw him enter the house of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im and shut the door. `Al&iacute;-<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h related this event in many
gatherings. He used to say: "O people! I am not a <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute;, but
this deed is the work of righteousness. None but a man of truth
would act in this way."'<a name="Nanchor_P3" id="Nanchor_P3"></a><a href="#Note_P3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Chief Priest Hajee Seid Kausem did all in his power
to prevent hostilities, he preached against their proceedings,
he was abused and threatened, they would not
listen to him&mdash;this I have heard from many people at
Kerbella&mdash;at this time all were unanimous in defending
the place</p>

<p>... to the very last he entreated them to listen to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Pacha but without avail, he shewed great courage on the
occasion, as he had all the chief Geramees<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> and Mollahs
against him.<a name="Nanchor_P4" id="Nanchor_P4"></a><a href="#Note_P4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Unhappily, his counsel was ignored by both rebels and
Turks. In January 1843, after a siege of twenty-four days,
the holy city was taken by assault, causing great suffering
to the innocent inhabitants. The files of the Public Record
Office in London contain several documents that throw
light on this episode, as well as on the central part played by
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im. (See <a href="#Page_193">Appendix I</a>.)</p>

<p>During the siege &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im had spent himself in
an effort to forestall violence and protect all parties to the
conflict. Although only fifty years of age, he became aware
that his life was nearing its close. He was warned of this,
we are told, by the dream of an Arab shepherd who recounted
it to him. When his disciples expressed their distress,
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im replied:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Is not your love for me for the sake of that true One whose
advent we all await? Would you not wish me to die, that
the promised One may be revealed?<a name="Nanchor_P5" id="Nanchor_P5"></a><a href="#Note_P5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The year 1844 was about to dawn when Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im
breathed his last and was laid to rest near the tomb of Im&aacute;m
&#7716;usayn. His death was reported by Farrant, who wrote
on January 24th 1844 to Sir Stratford Canning, sending a
copy in February to Lt.-Col. (later Sir) Justin Sheil,<a name="Nanchor_P6" id="Nanchor_P6"></a><a href="#Note_P6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the
British charg&eacute; d'affaires in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Hajee Seid Kausem one of the Chief Priests of Kerbella
died lately on his return from a visit to Samerrah&mdash;Seid
Ibrahim Kasveenee the other Chief Priest who was greatly
opposed to him, will now enjoy full power, and all contention
between the two religious parties will cease.<a name="Nanchor_P7" id="Nanchor_P7"></a><a href="#Note_P7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>When Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn-i-Bu<span class="u">sh</span>r&uacute;'&iacute; returned to Karbil&aacute;
from his highly successful mission in &Iacute;r&aacute;n, his teacher was
dead. He had not appointed anyone to succeed him.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>To follow the events of this narrative, it may be helpful
to consider their background in some aspects of Iranian
history.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, the third monarch of the Q&aacute;j&aacute;r dynasty,
ruled the land in 1843, but real power rested in the hands of
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;, his unprepossessing Grand Vizier. The
Q&aacute;j&aacute;rs were a tribe of Turkish origin. &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, a eunuch chieftain of this tribe, arose in the year
1779 to carve out a kingdom for himself. Fifteen years later
he finally won the crown of &Iacute;r&aacute;n when he captured and
brutally murdered Lu&#7789;f-`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the last ruler of the Zand
dynasty, who was brave and high-minded but piteously
young. The eunuch king was utterly and savagely ruthless,
and he managed to hold off the Russians in the area of the
Caucasus until 1797 when he was struck down by three
assassins. He was succeeded by his nephew, Fat&#7717;-`Al&iacute;
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, a man of soft heart and weak will, who was highly
uxorious. At his death in 1834, fifty-three sons and forty-six
daughters survived him.</p>

<p>During the reign of Fat&#7717;-`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, &Iacute;r&aacute;n lost heavily to
Russia in a series of disastrous wars. Her ministers, comfortably
cocooned in their isolation from the currents of
world affairs, and totally ignorant of the realities of the
European situation, believed that with the aid of the Emperor
of France the Russian menace could be thwarted. Hard
on the heels of General Gardanne, Bonaparte's envoy, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
one but two envoys from the more familiar 'Ingr&iacute;z' (English)
came in 1808. Sir Harford Jones had been dispatched
from the court of King George III and Sir John Malcolm
from India. In 1801 the latter, on behalf of the Marquis of
Wellesley, Governor-General of India, concluded an abortive
treaty with the shrewd and immensely ambitious
Grand Vizier<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> of Fat&#7717;-`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h. But in the intervening
years Bonaparte, subsequent to his <i>d&eacute;bacle</i> in Egypt and
Syria, showered his dubious favours on the Persians, and
the British connexion was conveniently ignored by the
ministers of Fat&#7717;-`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, who had entered into the Treaty
of Finkenstein (1807) with the French. Moreover, in the
same period, the most capable &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, who had
contributed more than anyone to the downfall of the Zand
dynasty and the ensuing victories of the eunuch king, fell
from power and, as legend has it, met his death in a boiling
cauldron.</p>

<p>Indeed, high hopes centred on what the Emperor of
France would do for &Iacute;r&aacute;n, only to be dashed by Bonaparte's
change of policy; when he met Tsar Alexander I at Tilsit
(1807) he did not remember any of his promises. And so
General Gardanne was ignominiously ousted from &#7788;ihr&aacute;n,
and Sir Harford Jones and Sir John Malcolm were left at
peace, to glower at each other, much to the amusement and
also surprise and embarrassment of the Persian ministers.
But as Napoleon's star waned, so did the interest of the
British in Persian affairs. The wars with Russia went on until
the Persians acknowledged defeat in the Treaty of Gulist&aacute;n
of 1813.</p>

<p>Amidst abysmal ignorance, nepotism and malpractice
which abounded in the realm, there stood two men in
particular, untouched by corruption, who were fully aware
of the needs of their country: Prince `Abb&aacute;s M&iacute;rz&aacute;, the heir
to the throne, and his vizier, M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Q&aacute;sim, Q&aacute;'im-Maq&aacute;m-i-Far&aacute;h&aacute;n&iacute;. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
their attempts at reform could not
obtain the success they deserved because of the obscurantism
surrounding the person of the sovereign. It was this
Crown Prince who sent the first group of Iranian students
to Britain to learn the crafts of the West. Their story, which
does no credit to the government in London, is preserved
in a number of documents lodged in the Public Record
Office. Incidentally, one of these men, a student of medicine,
was named M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; B&aacute;b&aacute;, the eponym of the chief
character of James Morier's well-known satire.</p>

<p>Prince `Abb&aacute;s M&iacute;rz&aacute;, worsted in the field by the Russians,
now tried to provide his country with a modern army and
engaged British instructors. As in the past, &#7788;ihr&aacute;n gave him
little help. Yet he was under constant pressure to resume
hostilities. The divines, particularly, were urging it.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> Yet
Russia had no desire to fight; nor had Fat&#7717;-`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h: war
was too expensive. Prince Menchikov arrived from St.
Petersburg (the present-day Leningrad) not to dictate but
to negotiate. But the demands of those who sought war&mdash;the
clerics and the powerful court faction of All&aacute;h-Y&aacute;r
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>&mdash;proved irresistible; Menchikov returned to St.
Petersburg.</p>

<p>In the war that soon followed the Persians were soundly
beaten and Russian forces surged forward to occupy the
city of Tabr&iacute;z. The first to abandon the field was a group of
clerics, who, with raised standards, had accompanied the
army. By the Treaty of Turkuman<span class="u">ch</span>&aacute;y (1828), onerous
and humiliating in the extreme, &Iacute;r&aacute;n was excluded from the
Caucasus. In addition to the payment of heavy indemnities,
she lost her rights in the Caspian Sea and the frontier between
Russia and &Iacute;r&aacute;n was fixed on the river Aras.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>Prince `Abb&aacute;s M&iacute;rz&aacute; was now a sad and broken man.
Rash actions forced upon him had brought total desolation.
His modern army was shattered. Because he knew of the
intrigues that plagued his father's court, and to make certain
that his eldest son would not be left undefended, he
asked for guarantees from the Tsar, which were readily
given. After this ordeal of defeat and submission Prince
`Abb&aacute;s M&iacute;rz&aacute; did not live long. He died at the age of
forty-five, and a year later his father followed him to the
grave.</p>

<p>The eldest son of `Abb&aacute;s M&iacute;rz&aacute;, named heir-apparent by
Fat&#7717;-`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, came into his heritage by a combination
of the assured support of Britain and Russia, and the wise
strategy of Q&aacute;'im-Maq&aacute;m. Sir John Campbell, the British
Minister in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, and Sir Henry Lindesay Bethune, who
took command of the forces loyal to the son of `Abb&aacute;s
M&iacute;rz&aacute;, brought him safely from Tabr&iacute;z to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. Q&aacute;'im-Maq&aacute;m,
in the meantime, secured the backing of influential
men in the capital, where another son of the late king had
styled himself `Adil <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a
href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> and was claiming the throne.
But his reign was brief, and soon Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, the
heir-apparent, was well entrenched in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, for Sir Henry
Lindesay Bethune (whom a Persian historian calls Mr.
Lenzi) easily routed other pretenders.<a name="Nanchor_P8" id="Nanchor_P8"></a><a href="#Note_P8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h did not wish to seem beholden to the
British officials who had helped him to his throne, nor did
he show much gratitude to Q&aacute;'im-Maq&aacute;m, the architect
of his victory. Within a year he contrived the death of that
great minister who had served him and his father so well.
By the death of Q&aacute;'im-Maq&aacute;m, treacherously designed,
&Iacute;r&aacute;n sustained a tremendous and irreparable loss. Q&aacute;'im-Maq&aacute;m
was not only a brilliant statesman, but also a master<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of prose whose style rescued the language from encrusted
artificialities.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<p>His successor as the Grand Vizier was &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;,
a man ignorant and devoid of all graces, affecting deep piety.
This is how Sir Henry Layard<a name="Nanchor_P9" id="Nanchor_P9"></a><a href="#Note_P9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> saw him in 1840:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We waited upon the Prime Minister, the Haji Mirza
Agasi, who was then the man of the greatest influence,
power and authority in Persia. The Shah had committed
to him almost the entire government of his kingdom,
occupying himself but little with public affairs, aware
of his own incapacity for conducting them. 'The Haji'&mdash;the
name by which he was familiarly known&mdash;was, by all
accounts, a statesman of craft and cunning, but of limited
abilities. He was cruel and treacherous, proud and overbearing,
although he affected the humility of a pious
mulla who had performed the pilgrimage to Mecca and
the holy shrines of the Imaums. The religious character
which he had assumed made him intolerant and bigoted,
and he was known to be a fanatical hater of Christians.
He had been the Shah's tutor and instructor in the Koran,
and had acquired a great influence over his pupil, who had
raised him to the lofty position which he then held. He had
the reputation of being an accomplished Persian and
Arabic scholar, but he was entirely ignorant of all European
languages. His misgovernment, and the corruption
and general oppression which everywhere existed had
brought Persia to the verge of ruin. Distress, misery, and
discontent prevailed to an extent previously unknown.
He was universally execrated as the cause of the misfortunes
and misery from which the people and the State
were suffering. We found him seated on his hams, in the
Persian fashion, on a fine Kurdish carpet spread in a
handsome hall. Before him was a large tray filled with ices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and a variety of fruit.... He was a man of small stature,
with sharp and somewhat mean and forbidding features,
and a loud shrill voice. His dress was simple&mdash;almost
shabby&mdash;as became a mulla and a man devoted to religious
life.... It was evident that the Haji suspected that
we were spies and agents of the British Government.
However, he declared that the Shah was willing that we
should visit any part of his territories where we could
travel in safety, and that orders had been issued for the
preparation of our farman [royal decree]; for his Majesty
had said that we belonged to a friendly nation, and his
quarrel was not with England but with Lord Palmerston,
who had treated Persia ill, and had recalled the Queen's
Ambassador<a name="Nanchor_P10" id="Nanchor_P10"></a><a href="#Note_P10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> without sufficient cause....</p></blockquote>

<p>Nor was &Iacute;r&aacute;n on good terms with the Ottomans. Layard's
book, <i>Early Adventures</i>, indicates the considerable extent
of the incursions which the Turks had made into Iranian
territory. The meeting between Layard and &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
&Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; in 1840 took place in Hamad&aacute;n, not far from the
frontier, where Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h was encamped with his
army. The relations between the Ottoman and Iranian
governments were further strained by the storming and
sacking of Karbil&aacute; in January 1843, where the chief sufferers
were Persian. We have seen how the Persian princes living
in Karbil&aacute; at the time of its investment by the troops of
Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; took a hand in negotiations. They were exiles
and fugitives who had contested with Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h
and offended him, and senior among them was `Al&iacute;-<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h,
the &#7826;illu's-Sul&#7789;&aacute;n.</p>

<p>Yet another issue reared its ugly head to exacerbate
relations between &Iacute;r&aacute;n and the Ottoman Empire, that
of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah against Sunn&iacute;. Sheil, the British Minister in
&#7788;ihr&aacute;n, reported to the Foreign Secretary, the Earl of
Aberdeen:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>If the Moollahs, and in particular the chief priest of Ispahan,
Hajee Syed Moollah Mahomed Baukir, whose
religious influence in Persia is powerful, should use the
present opportunity for regaining their former position
by exerting their authority among the people, and preaching
a crusade against the rival branch of Mahommedanism,
it is not easy to foresee the consequences.<a name="Nanchor_P11"
id="Nanchor_P11"></a><a href="#Note_P11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, reported Sheil, the Persian Foreign Minister and
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;
were considering the possibility of war.<a name="Nanchor_P12"
id="Nanchor_P12"></a><a href="#Note_P12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>This chief priest of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, mentioned by Sheil, was the
same divine from whom Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn-i-Bu<span class="u">sh</span>r&uacute;'&iacute; obtained
unqualified support for Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;.</p>

<p>It is helpful to compare the authority of the divines of
these two great branches of Isl&aacute;m. The <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah divine in
contradistinction to the Sunn&iacute; has the power of 'Ijtih&aacute;d',
that is, issuing <i>ex cathedra</i> decrees and judgments. His
position is, in a sense, analogous to that of the English
judge who can, within the boundaries of equity and common
law, establish precedents. The Sunn&iacute; divine belongs to one
of the four schools of Islamic jurisprudence: the &#7716;anaf&iacute;,
the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;fi`&iacute;, the M&aacute;lik&iacute; and the &#7716;anbal&iacute;. The jurisconsults,
who founded these four schools or rites, which are named
after them, set certain standards from which the Sunn&iacute;
divine cannot deviate. The <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah divine, on the other
hand, relies exclusively on the text of the Qur'&aacute;n and the
Traditions ascribed to the Prophet and the Im&aacute;ms, all of
which are wide open to interpretation. Moreover, the <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah
mujtahid&mdash;the divine who pronounces <i>ex cathedra</i>&mdash;does so,
it is understood, as the deputy of the &#7778;&aacute;&#7717;ibu'z-Zam&aacute;n, the
Lord of the Age.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of May 22nd 1844 a traveller stood outside
the gates of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. He had come from Karbil&aacute;, on a spiritual
quest to his native land of &Iacute;r&aacute;n. A boat had taken him to
B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr on the Persian Gulf. From that insalubrious port his
route had lain over forbidding mountains to the renowned
city of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. He was accompanied by his brother and his
nephew, both barely twenty years old, and he himself but
in his early thirties. They had undertaken this journey for a
purpose which to many seemed fantastic. But for themselves
and many more like them it was real and urgent.</p>

<p>This traveller was the same Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn-i-Bu<span class="u">sh</span>r&uacute;'&iacute;,
who, after the accomplishment of his highly fruitful mission
in &Iacute;r&aacute;n on behalf of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;, had reached
Karbil&aacute; only to find his teacher dead. He had learned that
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im's parting counsel to his disciples had been to
leave their homes and their cloisters, to abandon their
studies and their debates and go out into the world to seek
'the Lord of the Age' (&#7778;&aacute;&#7717;ibu'z-Zam&aacute;n) whose advent had
for centuries been the hope of countless millions. His
supernal light would soon break upon the world, Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im had said. Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn together with a number of
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im's disciples kept vigil for forty days in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
mosque of K&uacute;fih, nearly in ruins, and then set out on different
routes to do their master's bidding.</p>

<p>Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was a man of profound scholarship and
unbending will. Nothing daunted him. Now, reaching the
gates of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, he sent his companions into the city to
obtain lodgings, but he himself tarried for a while in the
fields. His mind was occupied with the object of his quest,
a quest that had brought him all those wearisome miles to
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, the home and the resting-place of two of the greatest
poets of &Iacute;r&aacute;n. Here, some five hundred years before, &#7716;&aacute;fi&#7827;
had composed his superb, ethereal lyrics. Here Sa`d&iacute; had
lived a good part of his life and had written his lucid prose,
his lambent verse. Here had worked and died a host of men
celebrated both in their own days and thereafter. The air of
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, the plain of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, the roses of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, the cypresses
of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, have all been lavishly praised.</p>

<p>Forty-four years later, the young Edward Granville
Browne, the future eminent orientalist of the University of
Cambridge, looked at the plain of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z from the heights
facing the road to B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr, that mountain pass which is
named All&aacute;h-u-Akbar (God is the Greatest) because the
traveller thus expresses his wonderment at beholding such
a beauteous plain. Browne wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Words cannot describe the rapture which overcame me
as, after many a weary march, I gazed at length on the
reality of that whereof I had so long dreamed, and found
the reality not merely equal to, but far surpassing, the
ideal which I had conceived. It is seldom enough in one's
life that this occurs. When it does, one's innermost being is
stirred with an emotion which baffles description, and which
the most eloquent words can but dimly shadow forth.<a name="Nanchor_I1" id="Nanchor_I1"></a><a href="#Note_I1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This was the city that Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was about to enter.
It was as if a magnet had drawn him, with his brother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his nephew, to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. Nor were they alone in being thus
drawn.</p>

<p>On this hot afternoon of May 22nd, Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was
fatigued after the trying journey from the coast up the
precipitous tracks of the rising plateau. But his mind was
alert and his soul yearned for that peace which the attainment
of his goal would bring him. As he walked and
pondered he came face to face with a Youth of striking
appearance. That young Man, who was gentle and gracious
and whose turban proclaimed His descent from the Prophet
Mu&#7717;ammad, greeted him with great kindness. Mull&aacute;
&#7716;usayn was amazed and overwhelmed by the warmth of
this unexpected welcome. It was the courtesy coupled with
the dignified mien of this young Siyyid<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> which particularly
impressed him. Then the young Man invited him to be His
guest and to partake of the evening meal at His house.
Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn mentioned that his companions had gone
ahead and would be awaiting him, to which the young
Siyyid replied: 'Commit them to the care of God; He will
surely protect and watch over them'.<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<p>'We soon found ourselves standing at the gate of a house
of modest appearance,' Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn has recounted. 'He
knocked at the door, which was soon opened by an Ethiopian
servant. "Enter therein in peace, secure,"<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> were His
words as He crossed the threshold and motioned me to
follow Him. His invitation, uttered with power and majesty,
penetrated my soul. I thought it a good augury to be
addressed in such words, standing as I did on the threshold
of the first house I was entering in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, a city the very
atmosphere of which had produced already an indescribable
impression upon me.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z had cast its spell upon Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn. But little did
he think that his youthful Host, whose utterance rang with
authority, was that 'Lord of the Age', that 'Q&aacute;'im of the
House of Mu&#7717;ammad' whom he was seeking. Yet he could
not escape the feeling that the unexpected encounter might
in some way bring him near the end of his quest. At the
same time he was uneasy at having left his brother and
nephew with no news of himself. He further recounts:
'Overwhelmed with His acts of extreme kindness, I arose to
depart. "The time for evening prayer is approaching," I
ventured to observe. "I have promised my friends to join
them at that hour in the Masjid-i-&Iacute;l<span class="u">kh</span>&aacute;n&iacute;".<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> With extreme
courtesy and calm He replied: "You must surely have made
the hour of your return conditional upon the will and
pleasure of God. It seems that His will has decreed otherwise.
You need have no fear of having broken your pledge."' Such
undoubted assurance should have made Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn aware
that he was about to experience the supreme test of his life.</p>

<p>They prayed together. They sat down to converse. And
suddenly his Host asked Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn: 'Whom, after
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im, do you regard as his successor and your
leader?' Furthermore, He asked: 'Has your teacher given
you any detailed indications as to the distinguishing features
of the promised One?' Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn replied that Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im had laid the injunction upon his disciples to disperse
after his death and seek 'the Lord of the Age', and
indeed he had given them indications by which they could
come to recognize Him. 'He is of a pure lineage, is of illustrious
descent,' said Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, 'and of the seed of
F&aacute;&#7789;imih.<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> As to His age, He is more than twenty and less
than thirty. He is endowed with innate knowledge, ...
abstains from smoking, and is free from bodily deficiency.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>There was silence&mdash;the pause that precedes the breaking
of the dawn. Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn has told us that the silence was
broken with 'vibrant voice' by his Host who declared to
him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Behold, all these signs are manifest in Me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was for the moment shocked and bewildered.
He tried to resist a claim so breath-taking. But Truth
looked him in the face. He marshalled arguments. But Truth
is its own argument.</p>

<p>Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn said: 'He whose advent we await is a Man
of unsurpassed holiness, and the Cause He is to reveal [is]
a Cause of tremendous power. Many and diverse are the
requirements which He who claims to be its visible embodiment
must needs fulfil. How often has Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im
referred to the vastness of the knowledge of the promised
One! How often did he say: "My own knowledge is but a
drop compared with that with which He has been endowed.
All my attainments are but a speck of dust in the face of the
immensity of His knowledge. Nay, immeasurable is the
difference!"'</p>

<p>In days gone by Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn had written a dissertation
on some of the abstruse doctrines and teachings which
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad and Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im had enunciated. He carried
a copy of this treatise with him. He now presented it to his
Host and asked Him to peruse it, and elucidate the mysteries
which it contained. Not only did his Host after a rapid look
through that treatise shed light upon it, He went far beyond
it. Then Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was given the proof of which he had
ample knowledge. There is a S&uacute;rih (Arabic 'S&uacute;rah': chapter)
in the Qur'&aacute;n entitled the S&uacute;rih of Joseph.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> It tells the story
of Joseph, the son of Jacob, he whom his brothers betrayed
and sold into slavery, who suffered imprisonment in Egypt,
but rose to rule that land. It is highly allegorical. Siyyid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>K&aacute;&#7827;im had told Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, when requested by him to
write a commentary on that chapter of the Qur'&aacute;n: 'This is,
verily, beyond me. He, that great One, who comes after me
will, unasked, reveal it for you. That commentary will
constitute one of the weightiest testimonies of His truth, and
one of the clearest evidences of the loftiness of His position.'</p>

<p>Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn's Host told him: 'Now is the time to reveal
the commentary on the S&uacute;rih of Joseph.'</p>

<p>'He took up His pen,' Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn related, 'and with
incredible rapidity revealed the entire S&uacute;rih of Mulk, the
first chapter of His commentary on the S&uacute;rih of Joseph.
The overpowering effect of the manner in which He wrote
was heightened by the gentle intonation of His voice which
accompanied His writing. Not for one moment did He
interrupt the flow of the verses which streamed from His
pen. Not once did He pause till the S&uacute;rih of Mulk was
finished. I sat enraptured by the magic of His voice and the
sweeping force of His revelation.'</p>

<p>But Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was anxious to rejoin his companions.
Since that afternoon&mdash;and long ago it seemed&mdash;when he
had sent them into the city and had himself lingered outside
the city-gates, he had had no news of them nor they of him.
So he rose and asked to be permitted to depart. His Host
smilingly told him: 'If you leave in such a state, whoever
sees you will assuredly say: "This poor youth has lost his
mind."' 'At that moment,' Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn has said, 'the
clock registered two hours and eleven minutes after sunset.'</p>

<p>In that moment a new Dispensation was born.</p>

<p>'This night,' said He who ushered in the new Dispensation,
He who was to herald a new cycle, 'this very hour
will, in the days to come, be celebrated as one of the greatest
and most significant of all festivals.'<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>

<p>The evening meal was now served. Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
afterwards recalled: 'That holy repast refreshed alike my body
and soul. In the presence of my Host, at that hour, I felt
as though I were feeding upon the fruits of Paradise....
Had my youthful Host no other claim to greatness, this
were sufficient&mdash;that He received me with that quality of
hospitality and loving-kindness which I was convinced no
other human being could possibly reveal.</p>

<p>'I sat spellbound by His utterance, oblivious of time and
of those who awaited me.... Sleep had departed from me
that night. I was enthralled by the music of that voice which
rose and fell as He chanted; now swelling forth as He revealed
verses of the Qayy&uacute;mu'l-Asm&aacute;',<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> again acquiring
ethereal, subtle harmonies as He uttered the prayers He was
revealing. At the end of each invocation, He would repeat
this verse: "Far from the glory of thy Lord, the All-Glorious,
be that which His creatures affirm of Him! And
peace be upon His Messengers! And praise be to God, the
Lord of all beings!"<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a>' Such was Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn's recollection
of that momentous night.</p>

<p>Then He who stood as the Vicegerent of God on earth
thus addressed Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, who only a few hours before
had been so anxious, tormented and unsure:</p>

<blockquote><p>O thou who art the first to believe in Me! Verily I say,
I am the B&aacute;b, the Gate of God, and thou art the B&aacute;bu'l-B&aacute;b,
the gate of that Gate. Eighteen souls must, in the
beginning, spontaneously and of their own accord,
accept Me and recognise the truth of My Revelation.
Unwarned and uninvited, each of these must seek independently
to find Me. And when their number is complete,
one of them must needs be chosen to accompany
Me on My pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. There I shall
deliver the Message of God to the <span class="u">Sh</span>ar&iacute;f of Mecca.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>And then He laid this injunction upon 'the first to believe'
in Him: 'It is incumbent upon you not to divulge, either to
your companions or to any other soul, that which you have
seen and heard.'</p>

<p>'This Revelation,' Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn has further related, 'so
suddenly and impetuously thrust upon me, came as a
thunderbolt which, for a time, seemed to have benumbed
my faculties. I was blinded by its dazzling splendour and
overwhelmed by its crushing force. Excitement, joy, awe,
and wonder stirred the depths of my soul. Predominant
among these emotions was a sense of gladness and strength
which seemed to have transfigured me. How feeble and
impotent, how dejected and timid, I had felt previously!
Then I could neither write nor walk, so tremulous were my
hands and feet. Now, however, the knowledge of His
Revelation had galvanised my being. I felt possessed of such
courage and power that were the world, all its peoples and
its potentates, to rise against me, I would, alone and undaunted,
withstand their onslaught. The universe seemed but
a handful of dust in my grasp.'</p>

<p>On that early morning of May 23rd 1844 when Mull&aacute;
&#7716;usayn stepped out into the streets of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, his heart
brimming with joy, he abandoned a priestly career which
would have brought him high honours. He abandoned it
willingly and knowingly for a task which, though great
and noble, would bring him jeers and humiliation. He was
well-known amongst the circle of the divines who exercised
authority. He had the capacity, the intelligence and the
learning which would have placed him in years to come in
the forefront of the spiritual guides of the nation. Power and
riches would have been his. But by giving his allegiance to
the young Siyyid of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z whom he had met under such
strange circumstances, Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn renounced all this,
and chose a path in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was not alone in his high resolve.
Others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
with similar prospects of a clerical vocation journeyed to
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z in search of light and truth. They too had set out at
the bidding of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im. As if by a magnet, they were
drawn to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. How can one explain it otherwise? They
had no intimation that in this city lived the One whom
they sought. A force far greater than themselves led their
steps to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, to their journey's end. As ordained by the
B&aacute;b, they found Him, each one, independently. They were
true, sincere and eager and they had their reward.</p>

<p>The last to arrive was a youth of twenty-two, whose
home was in B&aacute;rfur&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span><a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> in the province of M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n
which borders the Caspian Sea. When he was a boy in his
early teens, his father, &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-&#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;, had died.
Devoting himself to the pursuit of learning he had joined the
circle of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im in Karbil&aacute;. Eventually, he became an
outstanding disciple of that remarkable teacher. It is recorded
that the night before this youth, whose name was Mull&aacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-`Ali, reached <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, the B&aacute;b told Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn
that on the following day one would arrive whose acceptance
of the new theophany would 'complete the number of
My chosen disciples'. Next evening as the B&aacute;b, accompanied
by Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, was going towards His house, they encountered
a young man whose dress and appearance showed
the effects of a long journey. The newcomer went to Mull&aacute;
&#7716;usayn whom he knew well as a fellow-disciple of Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im, greeted him and immediately asked whether he had
found the object of his quest. Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was not at
liberty to divulge the fact that he had, and he tried to pacify
his friend and avoid the subject. It was useless, for that youth
had seen the B&aacute;b. His retort to Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was astounding:
'Why seek you to hide Him from me? I can recognise
Him by His gait. I confidently testify that none besides
Him, whether in the East or in the West, can claim to be
the Truth. None other can manifest the power and majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
that radiate from His holy person.' Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was
amazed, and leaving the newcomer he walked on and told
the B&aacute;b what had transpired. Having already anticipated the
arrival of that youth, although he had certainly not received
any word from him, the B&aacute;b observed: 'Marvel not at his
strange behaviour. We have in the world of the spirit been
communing with that youth. We know him already....
Go to him and summon him forthwith to Our presence.'
Thus did Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;y-i-B&aacute;rfur&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;, whom the
B&aacute;b honoured with the title of Qudd&uacute;s (the Most Holy),
attain his heart's desire.</p>

<p>These disciples of the B&aacute;b are called the Letters of the
Living.<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23"
class="fnanchor">[W]</a> All but one met the B&aacute;b face to face, and recognized
in Him the Lord of the Age whom they sought. That
single exception was a gifted woman, an accomplished writer
of verse, courageous, a total stranger to fear, of whom Lord
Curzon says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Beauty and the female sex also lent their consecration to
the new creed, and the heroism of the lovely but ill-fated
poetess of Kazvin, Zerin Taj<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> (Crown of Gold), or
Kurrat-el-Ain (Solace of the Eyes), who, throwing off
the veil, carried the missionary torch far and wide, is one
of the most affecting episodes in modern history.<a name="Nanchor_I2" id="Nanchor_I2"></a><a href="#Note_I2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And here is the tribute of another eminent Englishman,
Edward Granville Browne, to this unique woman:</p>

<blockquote><p>The appearance of such a woman as &#7730;urratu'l-`Ayn is
in any country and any age a rare phenomenon, but in
such a country as Persia it is a prodigy&mdash;nay, almost a
miracle. Alike in virtue of her marvellous beauty, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
rare intellectual gifts, her fervid eloquence, her fearless
devotion and her glorious martyrdom, she stands forth
incomparable and immortal amidst her countrywomen.
Had the B&aacute;b&iacute; religion no other claim to greatness, this
were sufficient&mdash;that it produced a heroine like &#7730;urratu'l-`Ayn.<a
name="Nanchor_I3" id="Nanchor_I3"></a><a href="#Note_I3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Qurratu'l-`Ayn belonged to a family famed for its
learning. Her father, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mull&aacute; &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;, and her uncle, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute;,<a name="Nanchor_I4" id="Nanchor_I4"></a><a href="#Note_I4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
were both leading figures among
the clergy. But they were far too orthodox for this great
woman's spiritual susceptibilities, although a younger
uncle, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;, had become a supporter of the
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute; school.<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> Qurratu'l-`Ayn was married to the son of
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute;&mdash;her cousin, Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad.
They had children, but their marriage was disastrous.
Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad was even more fanatical and narrow-minded
than his father and a wide gulf yawned between
husband and wife.</p>

<p>Qurratu'l-`Ayn had another cousin, Mull&aacute; Jav&aacute;d, who
had accepted the rational views of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad and Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im. Having learned in this cousin's library of the teaching
of the illustrious sage of Karbil&aacute; who had gone far beyond
the limits of orthodoxy, Qurratu'l-`Ayn corresponded with
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im and gave him her allegiance. From him she
received the name Qurratu'l-`Ayn. In vain did her elders
attempt to dampen her enthusiasm. No persuasion or threat
could stop the tide of her newly-found devotion. And when
she decided to leave her home and her family and join the
circle of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im, nothing could thwart her purpose.
To appreciate the boldness and gravity of her action, one
must realize how sheltered were the Eastern women of those
days; her behaviour could be seen only as scandalous and
almost unprecedented. However, she reached Karbil&aacute; too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
late. Ten days prior to her arrival Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im had passed
away. Qurratu'l-`Ayn remained in Karbil&aacute;. She was convinced
that before long the One promised to them would
appear. Now, many of the disciples of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im were
setting out on their search. One of them was Qurratu'l-`Ayn's
brother-in-law, the husband of her younger sister Mar&#7693;&iacute;yyih.
She gave this relative, M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;, a sealed letter
and told him to deliver it to the One whom they expected
and sought. A verbal message in verse was added to the
letter: 'Say to Him, from me,' she said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The effulgence of thy face flashed forth and<br /></span>
<span class="i4">the rays of thy visage arose on high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then speak the word, "Am I not your<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lord?" and "Thou art, Thou art!"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">we will all reply.'<a name="Nanchor_I5" id="Nanchor_I5"></a><a href="#Note_I5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute; reached the presence of the
B&aacute;b, he gave Him the letter and the message; and the B&aacute;b
numbered her among the Letters of the Living. Thus it was
that this fearless, eloquent pioneer of woman's emancipation
joined the ranks of the first disciples of the B&aacute;b. Qurratu'l-`Ayn
is better known as &#7788;&aacute;hirih&mdash;the Pure One&mdash;a designation
by which she will ever be remembered.<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Letters of the Living, the eighteen disciples who
found the B&aacute;b 'independently and of their own accord',
were:</p>

later met with martyrdom in his youth.</p>

<p><i>Mull&aacute; &#7716;asan-i-Bajist&aacute;n&iacute;</i>. Doubts assailed him after the
martyrdom of the B&aacute;b, because he did not consider himself
worthy of the station given to him. Forced to leave his
home, he went to `Ir&aacute;q and attained the presence of
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;y-i-Bas&#7789;&aacute;m&iacute; was given the mission to return to
`Ir&aacute;q and inform the people in that heartland of the <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah
persuasion that the B&aacute;b had appeared, but not to divulge, as
yet, any particulars that might reveal His identity. To him
the B&aacute;b said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Your faith must be immovable as the rock, must weather
every storm and survive every calamity. Suffer not the
denunciations of the foolish and the calumnies of the
clergy to afflict you, or to turn you from your purpose.
For you are called to partake of the celestial banquet
prepared for you in the immortal Realm. You are the first
to leave the House of God, and to suffer for His sake. If
you be slain in His path, remember that great will be
your reward, and goodly the gift which will be bestowed
upon you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; was soon on his way to `Ir&aacute;q. Then the B&aacute;b
called together the other sixteen disciples and spoke to
them, adjuring them to go out into the world and serve
their God in the light of the faith given to them:</p>

<blockquote><p>O My beloved friends! You are the bearers of the name
of God in this Day. You have been chosen as the repositories
of His mystery. It behoves each one of you to
manifest the attributes of God, and to exemplify by your
deeds and words the signs of His righteousness, His power
and glory. The very members of your body must bear
witness to the loftiness of your purpose, the integrity
of your life, the reality of your faith, and the exalted
character of your devotion. For verily I say, this is the
Day spoken of by God in His Book: 'On that day will
We set a seal upon their mouths; yet shall their hands
speak unto Us, and their feet shall bear witness to that
which they shall have done.'<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> Ponder the words of Jesus
addressed to His disciples, as He sent them forth to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>propagate the Cause of God. In words such as these, He
bade them arise and fulfil their mission: 'Ye are even as
the fire which in the darkness of the night has been
kindled upon the mountain-top. Let your light shine
before the eyes of men. Such must be the purity of your
character and the degree of your renunciation, that the
people of the earth may through you recognise and be
drawn closer to the heavenly Father who is the Source of
purity and grace. For none has seen the Father who is
in heaven. You who are His spiritual children must by
your deeds exemplify His virtues, and witness to His
glory. You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt have
lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? Such must
be the degree of your detachment, that into whatever
city you enter to proclaim and teach the Cause of God,
you should in no wise expect either meat or reward from
its people. Nay, when you depart out of that city, you
should shake the dust from off your feet. As you have
entered it pure and undefiled, so must you depart from
that city. For verily I say, the heavenly Father is ever
with you and keeps watch over you. If you be faithful
to Him, He will assuredly deliver into your hands all the
treasures of the earth, and will exalt you above all the
rulers and kings of the world.' O My Letters! Verily I
say, immensely exalted is this Day above the days of the
Apostles of old. Nay, immeasurable is the difference!
You are the witnesses of the Dawn of the promised Day
of God. You are the partakers of the mystic chalice of His
Revelation. Gird up the loins of endeavour, and be mindful
of the words of God as revealed in His Book: 'Lo,
the Lord thy God is come, and with Him is the company
of His angels arrayed before Him!'<a name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> Purge your hearts
of worldly desires, and let angelic virtues be your adorning.
Strive that by your deeds you may bear witness to the
truth of these words of God, and beware lest, by 'turning
back',<a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> He may
'change you for another people',<a name="FNanchor_AC_29" id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> who<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
'shall not be your like',<a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> and who shall take from you the
Kingdom of God. The days when idle worship was
deemed sufficient are ended. The time is come when
naught but the purest motive, supported by deeds of
stainless purity, can ascend to the throne of the Most
High and be acceptable unto Him. 'The good word
riseth up unto Him, and the righteous deed will cause
it to be exalted before Him.'<a href="#Footnote_AD_30"
class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> You are the lowly, of
whom God has thus spoken in His Book: 'And We
desire to show favour to those who were brought low
in the land, and to make them spiritual leaders among
men, and to make them Our heirs.'<a name="FNanchor_AE_31"
id="FNanchor_AE_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a> You have been
called to this station; you will attain to it, only if you arise
to trample beneath your feet every earthly desire, and
endeavour to become those honoured servants of His
who speak not till He hath spoken, and who do His
bidding'. You are the first Letters that have been generated
from the Primal Point [the B&aacute;b], the first Springs that
have welled out from the Source of this Revelation.
Beseech the Lord your God to grant that no earthly
entanglements, no worldly affections, no ephemeral
pursuits, may tarnish the purity, or embitter the sweetness,
of that grace which flows through you. I am preparing
you for the advent of a mighty Day. Exert your
utmost endeavour that, in the world to come, I, who am
now instructing you, may, before the mercy-seat of God,
rejoice in your deeds and glory in your achievements.
The secret of the Day that is to come is now concealed.
It can neither be divulged nor estimated. The newly born
babe of that Day excels the wisest and most venerable
men of this time, and the lowliest and most unlearned of
that period shall surpass in understanding the most
erudite and accomplished divines of this age. Scatter
throughout the length and breadth of this land, and, with
steadfast feet and sanctified hearts, prepare the way for
His coming. Heed not your weaknesses and frailty; fix<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
your gaze upon the invincible power of the Lord, your
God, the Almighty. Has He not, in past days, caused
Abraham, in spite of His seeming helplessness, to triumph
over the forces of Nimrod? Has He not enabled Moses,
whose staff was His only companion, to vanquish Pharaoh
and his hosts? Has He not established the ascendancy of
Jesus, poor and lowly as He was in the eyes of men, over
the combined forces of the Jewish people? Has He not
subjected the barbarous and militant tribes of Arabia to
the holy and transforming discipline of Mu&#7717;ammad, His
Prophet? Arise in His name, put your trust wholly in
Him, and be assured of ultimate victory.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER 2<br />
HE WHOM THEY SOUGHT</h2>

<blockquote><p>The gentle spirit of the B&#257;b is surely high up in
the cycles of eternity. Who can fail, as Prof. Browne
says, to be attracted by him?</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;T. K. Cheyne, D.Litt., D.D.</p></blockquote>

<p>Siyyid (or M&iacute;rz&aacute;) `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad, known to history as the
B&aacute;b, was the son of Siyyid (or M&iacute;r) Mu&#7717;ammad-Ri&#7693;&aacute;, a
mercer of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z.<a name="Nanchor_II1" id="Nanchor_II1"></a><a
href="#Note_II1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>He was born on October 20th 1819
(Mu&#7717;arram 1st, 1235 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span>). Through both His father and
His mother He was descended from Im&aacute;m &#7716;usayn,<a name="FNanchor_AF_32" id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a><a
href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a> the
third Im&aacute;m. Thus He stood in direct line of descent from
the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad. According to M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Fa&#7693;l-i-Gulp&aacute;yg&aacute;n&iacute;,
Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad-Ri&#7693;&aacute;, the B&aacute;b's
father, died when his only child was an infant, unweaned.
Then the care of the child devolved upon a maternal uncle,
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;. He was the only relative of the B&aacute;b
to espouse His Cause openly during His lifetime and, as will
be seen, to accept martyrdom for His sake. But according to
a manuscript history of the B&aacute;b&iacute;-Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z by
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h-i-Afn&aacute;n,<a name="FNanchor_AG_33"
id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a> Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad-Ri&#7693;&aacute;
passed away when his son was nine years old, and `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;
appears to confirm this account.<a name="FNanchor_AH_34" id="FNanchor_AH_34"></a><a
href="#Footnote_AH_34" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Two of Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad-Ri&#7693;a's paternal cousins rose
to eminence in the ranks of the <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah divines, and both bore
allegiance, in strict secrecy, to their kinsman when His
claim to be 'the Q&aacute;'im of the House of Mu&#7717;ammad' became
publicly known. Of the two, the more famed and distinguished
was &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-&#7716;asan (1815-95),
known as M&iacute;rz&aacute;y-i-<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z&iacute;, who, like all the leading <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah
divines, resided in `Ir&aacute;q. He was the most influential
ecclesiastic of his time, powerful enough to wreck the
Tobacco R&eacute;gie, the monopoly concession which N&aacute;&#7779;iri'd-D&iacute;n
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h (reigned 1848-96) gave to Major Gerald F.
Talbot, a British citizen, in the summer of 1889.<a name="Nanchor_II2" id="Nanchor_II2"></a><a href="#Note_II2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
M&iacute;rz&aacute;y-i-<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z&iacute;
put the use of tobacco under an interdict and the
people of &Iacute;r&aacute;n, even the women in the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h's harem, ceased
to use it. N&aacute;&#7779;iri'd-D&iacute;n <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h was forced early in 1892 to
cancel the concession and pay the Tobacco Corporation
an indemnity of &pound;500,000. The father of M&iacute;rz&aacute;y-i-<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z&iacute;,
named M&iacute;rz&aacute; Ma&#7717;m&uacute;d, was a noted calligraphist, and was
uncle to the father of the B&aacute;b.</p>

<p>The other celebrated ecclesiastic, cousin to Siyyid
Mu&#7717;ammad-Ri&#7693;&aacute;, was &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d, the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih<a
name="FNanchor_AI_35" id="FNanchor_AI_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a>
of Kirm&aacute;n. It was Qudd&uacute;s who gave this dignitary the news
of the advent of the B&aacute;b. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d extended his
protection to Qudd&uacute;s, despite the clamour of his adversaries.</p>

<p>The mother of the B&aacute;b was F&aacute;&#7789;imih-Bagum. She was the
daughter of M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-&#7716;usayn, a merchant of
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, and had three brothers. Of these, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid
`Al&iacute; became the guardian of the B&aacute;b, while &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad and &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;asan-`Al&iacute;, although not
enlisted in the ranks of the followers of their illustrious
Nephew, feature in His story.</p>

<p>Every account that we have of Siyyid `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad's
childhood indicates that He was not an ordinary child.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>When He was sent to school, He so surprised the schoolmaster,
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid, with His wisdom and intelligence
that the bewildered man took the child back to His uncle,
and said that he had nothing to teach this gifted pupil: 'He,
verily, stands in no need of teachers such as I.' The uncle had
already noticed the remarkable qualities of his ward, and it is
recorded that on this occasion he was very stern with Him:
'Have You forgotten my instructions? Have I not already
admonished You to follow the example of Your fellow-pupils,
to observe silence, and to listen attentively to every
word spoken by Your teacher?' It was totally alien to the
nature of that gentle child to disregard the wishes of His
guardian. He returned to school and conducted Himself on
the pattern of other children. Nothing, however, could
restrain the superior mind and intelligence possessed by that
exceptional boy. As time went on, the schoolmaster became
convinced that he could not help his student; in the role of
instructor he felt as the instructed.</p>

<p>It should also be said that schools such as that attended
by Siyyid `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad, which were common in those
days, were one-man affairs and matters taught were elementary,
although pupils were trained to read the Qur'&aacute;n,
even if they could not possibly understand the meaning of
the sacred text which is of course in Arabic. The B&aacute;b did
not go beyond this school nor the tuition of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid.
Thus His schooling was meagre.</p>

<p>The B&aacute;b was only five years old when He was sent to
receive tuition from <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh </span> `&Aacute;bid. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h's
narrative contains an account of His first day at school,
related by &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m-i-Ism&aacute;`&iacute;l Bag, a well-known
merchant of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, who was a fellow-scholar at the
age of twelve. The B&aacute;b had taken a seat, with great courtesy,
in between this boy and another pupil who was also much
older than Himself. His head was bowed over the primer
put in front of Him, the first lines of which He had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
taught to repeat. But He would not utter a word. When
asked why He did not read aloud as other boys were doing
He made no reply. Just then two boys, sitting near them,
were heard to recite a couplet from &#7716;&aacute;fi&#7827;, which runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From the pinnacles of Heaven they call out unto thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not what hath thee here entrapped.<a name="Nanchor_II3"
id="Nanchor_II3"></a><a href="#Note_II3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br /></span></div></div>

<p>'That is your answer,' said the B&aacute;b, turning to &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m.</p>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h also tells us that, apart from
teaching boys, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid had a regular class for theological
students. On one occasion some of these students
posed a question which after a long period of discussion
remained unresolved. <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid told them that he would
consult some authoritative works that same night and on
the morrow present them with the solution. Just then the
B&aacute;b, who had been listening, spoke and with sound reasoning
propounded the answer which they sought. They were
wonder-struck, for they had no recollection of discussing
that particular subject within earshot of the B&aacute;b, who might
then have looked up references in books and memorized
them to repeat parrot-wise. <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid asked Him where
He had gained that knowledge. The boy replied smilingly
with a couplet from &#7716;&aacute;fi&#7827;:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Should the grace of the Holy Spirit once again deign to assist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Others will also do what Christ could perform.<a href="#Note_II3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br /></span></div></div>

<p>Not only did the mental faculties of the B&aacute;b astound the
schoolmaster; the nobility of His character impressed him
even more. Indeed all those who were close or near to His
person could not but yield to the charm of His being. Years
later, when the B&aacute;b had raised the call of a new theophany,
the schoolmaster casting his mind over the past told &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
Siyyid Jav&aacute;d-i-Karbil&aacute;'&iacute;, a learned scion of a celebrated<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
priestly family (the Ba&#7717;ru'l-`Ul&uacute;m<a name="FNanchor_AJ_36"
id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a>), that Siyyid `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad
was always dignified and serene, that He was
very handsome and cared little for the pastimes of other
boys. Some mornings, the schoolmaster recalled, He was
late coming to school and when asked the reason He remained
silent. On occasions <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid sent other pupils
to call at His home and ask Him to come to school. They
would return to say that they had found Him at His devotions.
One day, when He had come late to school and was
questioned by <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid, the B&aacute;b said quietly that He
had been in the house of His 'Grandfather'. Thus do the
Siyyids refer to their ancestor the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad. To
the schoolmaster's remonstrances that He was only a child
of ten from whom such rigorous attention to devotions was
not demanded, He replied quietly again, 'I wish to be like
My Grandfather'. At that time, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid said, he had
taken the words of Siyyid `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad as childish
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>.<a name="Nanchor_II4" id="Nanchor_II4"></a><a href="#Note_II4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A certain book-binder of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z named Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad,
whose house neighboured that of the B&aacute;b's, but who
in later years removed to Sar&aacute;y-i-Am&iacute;r<a name="FNanchor_AK_37"
id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n to ply his
trade, had heard <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid relate that it was customary,
when the season was clement, for the boys to invite their
teacher and their fellow-pupils on Fridays (the day of rest)
to an outing in one of the numerous gardens which bordered
the city of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. At times they would find that the B&aacute;b
had betaken Himself to a shaded, secluded spot in a corner
of the orchard to pray and meditate.</p>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d-i-Karbil&aacute;'&iacute; had himself encountered the
B&aacute;b in the years of His childhood. He was normally a resident
of Karbil&aacute; and had attended regularly the discourses of
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;, eventually becoming one of his
ardent disciples. But he was also a man of travel who<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
embarked now and then on long journeys. Twice he went on
pilgrimage to Mecca and spent some time there teaching
and discoursing. He visited India and stayed in Bombay for
a while. One of his journeys took him to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, at a time
when the B&aacute;b was about nine years old. Being well
acquainted with &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad (one of the B&aacute;b's
maternal uncles), &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d visited him occasionally.
Decades later he recalled that on one of these visits he could
hear the intonations of a melodious, enraptured voice,
coming from the direction of the alcove reserved for
devotions. Before long a boy stepped out of the recess and
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad introduced Him as his nephew
who was orphaned. Another visit coincided with the B&aacute;b's
return from school. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d noticed that He held a
batch of papers and asked what they were. Very courteously
the boy replied that they were His calligraphic exercises.
When &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d inspected them he marvelled at their
excellence.</p>

<p>On yet another and later occasion, when the B&aacute;b was for a
time engaged in trading in the port of B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid
Jav&aacute;d spent six months in that town, living in the same
inn as the B&aacute;b. Thus they often met. Still later, in Karbil&aacute;,
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d again met the B&aacute;b, who by then was in
His early twenties.</p>

<p>When Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;y-i-Bas&#7789;&aacute;m&iacute; reached `Ir&aacute;q with the tidings
of the advent of the B&aacute;b, the news spread rapidly among the
divines and the students of theology. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d was
one of those particularly attracted, and he often urged
Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; to divulge the name of Him who had put forth
such a tremendous claim. But the B&aacute;b had emphatically
forbidden Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; to mention His name or give any clue
to His identity. To all insistent requests Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; merely
said that before long His identity would be revealed to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
them. No one, according to the testimony of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid
Jav&aacute;d, suspected that the B&aacute;b could be the young merchant
of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z who had only recently lived among them. Most of
the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute;s believed that the B&aacute;b must be one of the close
disciples of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d to invite Mull&aacute;
`Al&iacute; to his own home and question him more closely. Seated
on the roof of the house, in the neighbourhood of the Shrine
of Im&aacute;m &#7716;usayn, the two of them conversed at length
about the 'Great Event', but no matter how hard he tried,
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d could not induce his guest to disclose the
secret which he had been bidden to withhold. So frustrated
did he feel that, on his own admission, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid
Jav&aacute;d gripped the arms of Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;, pushed him hard
against the wall and exclaimed: 'What am I to do with you,
Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;! Kill you? Won't you say who that wondrous
Being is? Won't you relieve us of this misery?' Gasping for
breath, Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; replied: 'Siyyid Jav&aacute;d! It is forbidden.
You yourself are a man of learning. You should know
better. It is forbidden.' And then quite unexpectedly and
without knowing why, Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; added that the B&aacute;b had
specially mentioned that all His letters extant in `Ir&aacute;q,
whoever the recipient might have been, ought to be sent to
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. No sooner had Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; spoken than &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid
Jav&aacute;d had, in a flash, a mental picture of Siyyid `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad,
whom he had known and admired since His childhood.
He ran down the stairs to the room where he kept his papers,
gathered up the letters he had received from Siyyid `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad
and hurried back to the roof. The moment Mull&aacute;
`Al&iacute; caught sight of the seal on those letters he burst into
tears, and so did &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d. They wept for joy, and
between his sobs Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; kept repeating: `&Aacute;q&aacute; Siyyid
Jav&aacute;d! &Aacute;q&aacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d! I did not mention any name to
you. It is forbidden to mention His blessed name. Don't
mention His name to anyone.'<a name="Nanchor_II5" id="Nanchor_II5"></a><a href="#Note_II5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus did &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d-i-Karbil&aacute;'&iacute; find his new
Faith, to which he remained steadfastly loyal throughout his
long life. We shall hear later a good deal more of this remarkable
man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Siyyid `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad had some six to seven years of
schooling with <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid. In all probability He left the
school at the Qahviy-i-Awl&iacute;y&aacute;' before He was thirteen.
According to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h's narrative, He joined
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;, His uncle-guardian, in business when
He was fifteen years old,<a name="FNanchor_AL_38" id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a><a
href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a> and shortly afterwards moved to
B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr. Pages of commercial accounts which He kept
put it beyond doubt that the B&aacute;b left <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z for B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr
when He was nearly sixteen. There can be little doubt that
at an early age the B&aacute;b took over the complete management
of the trading-house in B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr. His scrupulous attention to
detail and His undeviating fairness in transactions became
widely known in the region. A man who had consigned to
Him some goods to sell was astonished to find, when he
received his money, that it was more than could be obtained
at current prices. He wanted to return some of it.
The B&aacute;b told him that it was only fair and just that he should
be given that particular sum, because his goods would have
fetched exactly that amount had they been offered for sale
when the market was at its best.</p>

<p>A.-L.-M. Nicolas maintains that the B&aacute;b was also engaged
in writing and composing, during this period of His sojourn
in B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr. He mentions a treatise, the <i>Ris&aacute;liy-i-Fiqh&iacute;yyih</i>,
as having come from the pen of the B&aacute;b during those
years.<a name="Nanchor_II6" id="Nanchor_II6"></a><a href="#Note_II6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
His statement is corroborated by &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h's
narrative:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One day in Egypt during the time when M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Fa&#7693;l
was occupied with writing his book, the <i>Far&aacute;'id</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>we came to talk about the early years of the B&aacute;b, prior
to His declaration, and the period when He was engaged
in trading. M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Fa&#7693;l related the following to me:
'I myself heard the late &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d-i-Karbil&aacute;'&iacute; say
that when the B&aacute;b was pursuing the career of a merchant
in B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr, he ... because of his friendship with the
uncles of the B&aacute;b used to stay with them whenever he
visited either <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z or B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr. One day &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad came to him with a request. "Give
some good counsel to my nephew ... tell Him not to
write certain things which can only arouse the jealousy
of some people: these people cannot bear to see a young
merchant of little schooling show such erudition, they feel
envious." &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad had been very
insistent that &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d should counsel the B&aacute;b to
desist from writing. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d had however
replied with these lines of verse: "The fair of face cannot
put up with the veil; Shut him in, and out of the window
will he show his visage," and had added: "We are earth-bound
and He is celestial. Our counsel is of no use to
Him."'</p></blockquote>

<p>Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-i-Zarand&iacute;, Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am, lays particular
stress on the B&aacute;b's strict regard for His devotions on
Fridays. Even the torrid conditions of B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr, he states,
did not deter the B&aacute;b. Writers of such histories as the
<i>N&aacute;si<span class="u">kh</span>u't-Tav&aacute;r&iacute;<span class="u">kh</span></i>,<a name="Nanchor_II7" id="Nanchor_II7"></a><a href="#Note_II7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
hostile to the B&aacute;b, have alleged that
long exposure to the severe heat of the sun in that seaport,
while engaged in prayers, affected His mind. They have gone
on to assert that it was this derangement of mind which led
Him to make extravagant claims. But &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; J&aacute;n&iacute; of
K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n refutes any suggestion that the B&aacute;b deliberately
practised austerities, or that He found Himself a 'mur<span class="u">sh</span>id'
(spiritual guide) to direct Him along such lines.</p>

<p>Unfortunately records of the years that the B&aacute;b spent in
B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr are scant. We cannot be certain as to the exact
dates when He took over the complete management of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
trading-house and when He retired. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu`&iacute;nu's-Sal&#7789;anih
of Tabr&iacute;z states in his chronicle that the B&aacute;b assumed direct
responsibility at the age of twenty. If that statement be
correct, the period during which He acted on His own was
quite brief. According to M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Fa&#7693;l of Gulp&aacute;yg&aacute;n,
He journeyed to the holy cities of `Ir&aacute;q in the spring of 1841,
stayed in `Ir&aacute;q for nearly seven months and returned to His
'native province of F&aacute;rs' in the autumn of that year. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h states that the B&aacute;b's sojourn in B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr
lasted six years. According to him, when the B&aacute;b decided
to go on pilgrimage to the holy cities of `Ir&aacute;q, He wrote to
His uncles in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z asking them to come and take over the
business from Him. His uncles, however, procrastinated,
whereupon the B&aacute;b settled all the outstanding matters in
B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr Himself, brought His books up to date, locked and
sealed the door of the office and left the keys with the gatekeeper
of the caravanserai, to be handed over to any one of
His uncles. He informed His uncles of what He had done
and explained that since they had not heeded His repeated
pleas He had no other alternative, determined as He was to
go on pilgrimage to the holy cities.<a name="FNanchor_AM_39"
id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a> &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid
Mu&#7717;ammad was greatly perturbed lest their credit be
damaged and their clients suffer serious loss. But &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute; assured him that their nephew would
never do anything to compromise them and that all accounts
would be found in perfect order. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad
hurried to B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr where a close inspection of the
books satisfied him that nothing had been left to chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>While in Karbil&aacute; the B&aacute;b visited Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute; and
attended his discourses. But these occasional visits did not
and could not make Him a pupil or disciple of Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im. His adversaries have alleged that He sat at the feet
of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im for months on end to learn from him. But
accounts that we have from close associates of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im
all indicate that the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute; leader welcomed and received
Siyyid `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad, on every occasion, with great
reverence. Here is a long account by <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My days were spent in the service of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im, to
whom I was greatly attached. One day, at the hour of
dawn, I was suddenly awakened by Mull&aacute; Naw-r&uacute;z, one
of his intimate attendants, who, in great excitement, bade
me arise and follow him. We went to the house of Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im, where we found him fully dressed, wearing his
`ab&aacute;, and ready to leave his home. He asked me to accompany
him. 'A highly esteemed and distinguished Person,'
he said, 'has arrived. I feel it incumbent upon us both to
visit Him.' The morning light had just broken when I
found myself walking with him through the streets of
Karbil&aacute;. We soon reached a house, at the door of which
stood a Youth, as if expectant to receive us. He wore a
green turban, and His countenance revealed an expression
of humility and kindliness which I can never describe.
He quietly approached us, extended His arms towards
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im, and lovingly embraced him. His affability
and loving-kindness singularly contrasted with the sense
of profound reverence that characterised the attitude of
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im towards Him. Speechless and with bowed
head, he received the many expressions of affection and
esteem with which that Youth greeted him. We were
soon led by Him to the upper floor of that house, and
entered a chamber bedecked with flowers and redolent
of the loveliest perfume. He bade us be seated. We knew
not, however, what seats we actually occupied, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>overpowering was the sense of delight which seized us. We
observed a silver cup which had been placed in the centre
of the room, which our youthful Host, soon after we were
seated, filled to overflowing, and handed to Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im,
saying: 'A drink of a pure beverage shall their Lord
give them.'<a name="FNanchor_AN_40" id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a> Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im held the cup with both hands
and quaffed it. A feeling of reverent joy filled his being, a
feeling which he could not suppress. I too was presented
with a cupful of that beverage, though no words were
addressed to me. All that was spoken at that memorable
gathering was the above-mentioned verse of the Qur'&aacute;n.
Soon after, the Host arose from His seat and, accompanying
us to the threshold of the house, bade us farewell.
I was mute with wonder, and knew not how to express
the cordiality of His welcome, the dignity of His bearing,
the charm of that face, and the delicious fragrance of
that beverage. How great was my amazement when I saw
my teacher quaff without the least hesitation that holy
draught from a silver cup, the use of which, according to
the precepts of Isl&aacute;m, is forbidden to the faithful. I could
not explain the motive which could have induced the
Siyyid to manifest such profound reverence in the presence
of that Youth&mdash;a reverence which even the sight of the
shrine of the Siyyidu'<span class="u">sh</span>-<span class="u">Sh</span>uhad&aacute;'<a name="FNanchor_AO_41" id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a> had failed to excite.
Three days later, I saw that same Youth arrive and take
His seat in the midst of the company of the assembled
disciples of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im. He sat close to the threshold,
and with the same modesty and dignity of bearing listened
to the discourse of the Siyyid. As soon as his eyes fell
upon that Youth, the Siyyid discontinued his address and
held his peace. Whereupon one of his disciples begged
him to resume the argument which he had left unfinished.
'What more shall I say?' replied Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im, as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>turned his face toward the B&aacute;b. 'Lo, the Truth is more
manifest than the ray of light that has fallen upon that
lap!' I immediately observed that the ray to which the
Siyyid referred had fallen upon the lap of that same Youth
whom we had recently visited. 'Why is it,' that questioner
enquired, 'that you neither reveal His name nor identify
His person?' To this the Siyyid replied by pointing with
his finger to his own throat, implying that were he to
divulge His name, they both would be put to death
instantly. This added still further to my perplexity. I had
already heard my teacher observe that so great is the
perversity of this generation, that were he to point with
his finger to the promised One and say: 'He indeed is the
Beloved, the Desire of your hearts and mine,' they would
still fail to recognise and acknowledge Him. I saw the
Siyyid actually point out with his finger the ray of light
that had fallen on that lap, and yet none among those who
were present seemed to apprehend its meaning. I, for my
part, was convinced that the Siyyid himself could never
be the promised One, but that a mystery inscrutable to us
all, lay concealed in that strange and attractive Youth.
Several times I ventured to approach Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im and
seek from him an elucidation of this mystery. Every time
I approached him, I was overcome by a sense of awe
which his personality so powerfully
inspired.<a name="Nanchor_II8" id="Nanchor_II8"></a><a href="#Note_II8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute; has gone on to relate:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I often felt the urge to seek alone the presence of that
H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>imite<a name="FNanchor_AP_42" id="FNanchor_AP_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a> Youth and to endeavour to fathom His
mystery. I watched Him several times as He stood in an
attitude of prayer at the doorway of the shrine of the
Im&aacute;m &#7716;usayn. So wrapt was He in His devotions that
He seemed utterly oblivious of those around Him. Tears
rained from His eyes, and from His lips fell words of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>glorification and praise of such power and beauty as even
the noblest passages of our sacred Scriptures could not
hope to surpass. The words 'O God, my God, my Beloved,
my heart's Desire,' were uttered with a frequency and
ardour that those of the visiting pilgrims who were near
enough to hear Him instinctively interrupted the course
of their devotions, and marvelled at the evidences of piety
and veneration which that youthful countenance evinced.
Like Him they were moved to tears, and from Him they
learned the lesson of true adoration. Having completed
His prayers, that Youth, without crossing the threshold
of the shrine and without attempting to address any words
to those around Him, would quietly return to His home.
I felt the impulse to address Him, but every time I ventured
an approach, a force that I could neither explain nor
resist, detained me. My inquiries about Him elicited the
information that He was a resident of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, that He was
a merchant by profession, and did not belong to any of
the ecclesiastical orders. I was, moreover, informed that
He, and also His uncles and relatives, were among the
lovers and admirers of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad and Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im.
I learned that He had departed for Najaf on His way to
<span class="u">Sh</span>iraz. That Youth had set my heart aflame. The memory
of that vision haunted me. My soul was wedded to His
till the day when the call of a Youth from <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, proclaiming
Himself to be the B&aacute;b, reached my ears. The
thought instantly flashed through my mind that such a
person could be none other than that selfsame Youth
whom I had seen in Karbil&aacute;, the Youth of my heart's
desire.<a name="Nanchor_II9" id="Nanchor_II9"></a><a href="#Note_II9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>According to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h's narrative, as the
sojourn of the B&aacute;b in the holy cities lengthened into months,
His mother, anxious to have her only son back in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z,
asked her brother, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;, to go to `Ir&aacute;q
and persuade Him to return. He could not deny his sister's
request, but when he reached `Ir&aacute;q he found that his nephew,
who had once been his ward, was unwilling to leave the<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
holy cities. Thereupon he appealed to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
Siyyid Jav&aacute;d-i-Karbil&aacute;'&iacute;
for help, who was at first reluctant to lend his
support, not wishing to lose the company of the young
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z&iacute; Siyyid whom he had over the course of years so
tremendously admired. However, when he learned that His
mother was greatly concerned, he consented to intervene.
At last the B&aacute;b complied with their request and agreed to
return. After a few months in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z He declared His
intention of going once again to `Ir&aacute;q. His mother, alarmed
and agitated by this decision, once more sought the aid of
her brother. Their efforts resulted in the marriage of the
B&aacute;b to <span class="u">Kh</span>ad&iacute;jih-Bagum, daughter of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
`Al&iacute;,<a name="Nanchor_II10" id="Nanchor_II10"></a><a
href="#Note_II10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
the paternal uncle of His mother. The marriage took place
in August 1842. <span class="u">Kh</span>ad&iacute;jih-Bagum had two brothers: &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Q&aacute;sim and &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Siyyid &#7716;asan, and both
of them, though not counted among His followers in His
lifetime, have a place in the story of the B&aacute;b. The descendants
of these two brothers-in-law of the B&aacute;b, and the
descendants of His maternal uncles, are known as the Afn&aacute;n
(the Twigs).</p>

<p>A son was born to Siyyid `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad and <span class="u">Kh</span>ad&iacute;jih-Bagum
in the year 1843, whom they named A&#7717;mad, but he
did not live long. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
&#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h states that the
child was still-born. The B&aacute;b notes the birth of A&#7717;mad in the
<i>Qayy&uacute;mu'l-Asm&aacute;'</i>, His commentary on the S&uacute;rih of Y&uacute;suf
(Joseph). Speaking of His wedding with His well-beloved,
who was herself descended from the Well-Beloved (Mu&#7717;ammad
is known as &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h&mdash;the Well-Beloved of God),
and relating how He had called upon the angels of Heaven
and the cohorts of Paradise to witness that wedding, the
B&aacute;b then addresses His wife:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>O well-beloved! Value highly the grace of <span class="u">Dh</span>ikr [the
Bab],<a name="Nanchor_II11" id="Nanchor_II11"></a><a
href="#Note_II11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
the Greatest, for it comes from God, the Loved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a>
</span>One. Thou shalt not be a woman, like other women, if
thou obeyest God in the Cause of Truth ... and
take pride in being the consort of the Well-Beloved,
who is loved by God the Greatest. Sufficient unto
thee is this glory which cometh unto thee from God, the
All-Wise, the All-Praised. Be patient in all that God hath
ordained concerning the B&aacute;b and His Family. Verily, thy
son, A&#7717;mad, is with F&aacute;&#7789;imih,<a name="FNanchor_AQ_43"
id="FNanchor_AQ_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a> the Sublime, in the
sanctified Paradise.<a name="Nanchor_II12" id="Nanchor_II12"></a>
<a href="#Note_II12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And there is this further reference to Ahmad in the
<i>Qayy&uacute;mu'l-Asm&aacute;'</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>All praise be to God Who bestowed upon the Solace
of the Eyes,<a name="FNanchor_AR_44" id="FNanchor_AR_44"></a><a
href="#Footnote_AR_44" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a> in His youth, A&#7717;mad. We did verily raise
him up unto God.... O Solace of the Eyes! Be patient
in what thy God hath ordained for thee. Verily He
doeth whatsoever He willeth. He is the All-Wise in the
exercise of His justice. He is thy Lord, the Ancient of
Days, and praised be He in whatever He ordereth.<a

<h2>CHAPTER 3<br />
&#7788;IHR&Aacute;N</h2>

<blockquote><p>Rejoice with great joy, for God hath made thee
'the Day-Spring of His light', inasmuch as within
thee was born the Manifestation of His Glory. Be

<p>... We stand, life in hand, wholly resigned to His

may lay down His life as a sacrifice in the path of the

<p>Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was sorely disappointed when he realized
that he was not to be the companion of the B&aacute;b, on His
pilgrimage to Mecca. But for the man who was the first to
find Him and believe in Him the B&aacute;b had marked out a task
infinitely glorious. Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was to go from <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z
to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, where the fulfilment of that task awaited him.
He had travelled to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z on a quest. There he had reached
its end, had found the Q&aacute;'im of the House of Mu&#7717;ammad.
Now he was to undertake another quest, and he was not
entirely aware of the consequences that would attend its
success. To him the B&aacute;b said:</p>

<blockquote><p>In this pilgrimage upon which We are soon to embark,
We have chosen Qudd&uacute;s as Our companion. We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a>
</span>left you behind to face the onslaught of a fierce and
relentless enemy. Rest assured, however, that a bounty
unspeakably glorious shall be conferred upon you.
Follow the course of your journey towards the north,
and visit on your way I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n,
Qum, and &#7788;ihr&aacute;n.
Beseech almighty Providence that He may graciously
enable you to attain, in that capital, the seat of true
sovereignty, and to enter the mansion of the Beloved.
A secret lies hidden in that city. When made manifest, it
shall turn the earth into paradise. My hope is that you
may partake of its grace and recognise its splendour.
From &#7788;ihr&aacute;n proceed to <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n, and there proclaim
anew the Call. From thence return to Najaf and Karbil&aacute;
and there await the summons of your Lord. Be assured
that the high mission for which you have been created
will, in its entirety, be accomplished by you. Until you
have consummated your work, if all the darts of an
unbelieving world be directed against you, they will be
powerless to hurt a single hair of your
head.<a name="Nanchor_III1" id="Nanchor_III1"></a><a
href="#Note_III1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When the time came for Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn to leave <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z,
the B&aacute;b told him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Grieve not that you have not been chosen to accompany
Me on My pilgrimage to &#7716;ij&aacute;z. I shall, instead, direct
your steps to that city which enshrines a Mystery of such
transcendent holiness as neither &#7716;ij&aacute;z nor
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z can hope
to rival. My hope is that you may, by the aid of God, be
enabled to remove the veils from the eyes of the wayward
and to cleanse the minds of the malevolent. Visit, on your
way, I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n, &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, and <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n. Proceed
thence to `Ir&aacute;q, and there await the summons of your
Lord, who will keep watch over you and will direct you
to whatsoever is His will and desire. As to Myself, I
shall, accompanied by Qudd&uacute;s and My Ethiopian servant,<a
name="FNanchor_AT_46" id="FNanchor_AT_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_AT_46" class="fnanchor">[AT]</a>
proceed on My pilgrimage to &#7716;ij&aacute;z. I shall join
the company of the pilgrims of F&aacute;rs, who will shortly be
sailing for that land. I shall visit Mecca and Medina, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a>
</span>there fulfil the mission<a name="FNanchor_AU_47"
id="FNanchor_AU_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU_47" class="fnanchor">[AU]</a> with which God has entrusted
Me. God willing, I shall return hither by the way of K&uacute;fih,
in which place I hope to meet you. If it be decreed
otherwise, I shall ask you to join Me in
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. The hosts
of the invisible Kingdom, be assured, will sustain and
reinforce your efforts. The essence of power is now
dwelling in you, and the company of His chosen angels
revolves around you. His almighty arms will surround
you, and His unfailing Spirit will ever continue to guide
your steps. He that loves you, loves God; and whoever
opposes you, has opposed God. Whoso befriends you,
him will God befriend; and whoso rejects you, him will
God reject.<a name="Nanchor_III2" id="Nanchor_III2"></a><a

<p>Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was known in I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, for there he had
obtained testimonials from the great mujtahid, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid
Mu&#7717;ammad-B&aacute;qir, in support of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;.
That eminent divine was now dead, but his son, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
Siyyid Asadu'll&aacute;h, walking in the footsteps of his illustrious
father, refused to associate himself with the adversaries
of Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn. Another noted divine,
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m-i-Kalb&aacute;s&iacute;,
did likewise, and sternly admonished
those who opposed Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn to cease their clamouring
and investigate dispassionately whatever he was advocating.
The Governor, Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the Mu`tamidu'd-Dawlih,
similarly declined to heed their strictures.</p>

<p>The first person in I&#7779;fah&aacute;n to embrace the new Faith was
a youth, a sifter of wheat. The B&aacute;b immortalizes his memory
in the Persian <i>Bay&aacute;n</i>:<a name="Nanchor_III3"
id="Nanchor_III3"></a><a href="#Note_III3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, that outstanding city, is distinguished by the
religious fervour of its <span class="u">sh</span>i`ah inhabitants, by the learning
of its divines, and by the keen expectation, shared by high
and low alike, of the imminent coming of the
&#7778;&aacute;&#7717;ibu'z-Zam&aacute;n.<a name="FNanchor_AV_48" id="FNanchor_AV_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_AV_48" class="fnanchor">[AV]</a>
In every quarter of that city, religious institutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
have been established. And yet, when the Messenger
of God had been made manifest, they who claimed to be
the repositories of learning and the expounders of the
mysteries of the Faith of God rejected His Message. Of all
the inhabitants of that seat of learning, only one person,
a sifter of wheat, was found to recognise the Truth, and
was invested with the robe of Divine
virtue!<a name="Nanchor_III4" id="Nanchor_III4"></a><a href="#Note_III4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Others eventually followed the example of that youth,<a name="FNanchor_AW_49" id="FNanchor_AW_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_49" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a>
among them M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad `Al&iacute;y-i-Nahr&iacute; and his brother,
M&iacute;rz&aacute; H&aacute;d&iacute;, who were Siyyids and highly respected. Mull&aacute;
&#7778;&aacute;diq-i-Muqaddas-i-<span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n&iacute; was another convert. Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im had told Mull&aacute; &#7778;&aacute;diq to establish his residence in
I&#7779;fah&aacute;n and pave the way for the coming of the Q&aacute;'im. That
man of iron courage (whom we shall encounter again in
the course of this story) met Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn in the home of
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;y-i-Nahr&iacute;. Mull&aacute; &#7778;&aacute;diq himself relates:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I asked Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn to divulge the name of Him who
claimed to be the promised Manifestation. He replied:
'To enquire about that name and to divulge it are alike
forbidden.' 'Would it, then, be possible,' I asked, 'for
me, even as the Letters of the Living, to seek independently
the grace of the All-Merciful and, through prayer,
to discover His identity?' 'The door of His grace,' he
replied, 'is never closed before the face of him who
seeks to find Him.' I immediately retired from his presence,
and requested his host to allow me the privacy of
a room in his house where, alone and undisturbed, I
could commune with God. In the midst of my contemplation,
I suddenly remembered the face of a Youth whom I
had often observed while in Karbil&aacute;, standing in an attitude
of prayer, with His face bathed in tears, at the entrance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>of the shrine of the Im&aacute;m &#7716;usayn. That same countenance
now reappeared before my eyes. In my vision I
seemed to behold that same face, those same features,
expressive of such joy as I could never describe. He
smiled as He gazed at me. I went towards Him, ready to
throw myself at His feet. I was bending towards the
ground, when, lo! that radiant figure vanished from before
me. Overpowered with joy and gladness, I ran out to
meet Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, who with transport received me and
assured me that I had, at last, attained the object of my
desire. He bade me, however, repress my feelings. 'Declare
not your vision to anyone,' he urged me; 'the time for it
has not yet arrived. You have reaped the fruit of your
patient waiting in I&#7779;fah&aacute;n. You should now proceed to
Kirm&aacute;n, and there acquaint &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Kar&iacute;m <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n
with this Message.<a name="FNanchor_AX_50" id="FNanchor_AX_50"></a><a
href="#Footnote_AX_50" class="fnanchor">[AX]</a> From that place you should travel to
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z and endeavour to rouse the people of that city
from their heedlessness. I hope to join you in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z and
share with you the blessings of a joyous reunion with our
Beloved.'<a name="Nanchor_III5" id="Nanchor_III5"></a><a
href="#Note_III5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n, Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn found a responsive and eager
heart in a well-known merchant of that town, named &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; J&aacute;n&iacute;.<a name="FNanchor_AY_51" id="FNanchor_AY_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_AY_51" class="fnanchor">[AY]</a> He too features prominently in the story of the
B&aacute;b. The next stage in Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn's journey was the
city of Qum, where the shrine of Ma'&#7779;&uacute;mih, the sister of
Im&aacute;m Ri&#7693;&aacute;, the eighth Im&aacute;m, is situated. He found no
attentive ears in Qum. Then came the crucial stage of his
journey, when he entered the capital city of &Iacute;r&aacute;n, for there
lay the 'Mystery' which the B&aacute;b had mentioned.</p>

<p>In &#7788;ihr&aacute;n Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn took a room in a theological
institution called the madrisih (school) of M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
alternatively the madrisih of P&aacute;min&aacute;r.<a name="FNanchor_AZ_52" id="FNanchor_AZ_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_AZ_52" class="fnanchor">[AZ]</a> The director of the
institution, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-i-<span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n&iacute;, was the
leading <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute; in the capital. He not only refused to heed
what Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn imparted, but severely remonstrated
with him and accused him of having betrayed the trust of
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad made it clear that in
his view Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn's presence in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n posed a threat
to the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute; community. Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn replied that he
did not intend to stay long in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, nor had he done or
said anything which detracted from the position of the
founders of the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute; school.</p>

<p>As far as he could, Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn kept away from the
madrisih of M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;. He went out early in the mornings
and returned after sunset. Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-i-Mu`allim,<a name="FNanchor_BA_53" id="FNanchor_BA_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA_53" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a> a
native of the district of N&uacute;r in M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n, has described
how Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn accomplished his mission:</p>

<blockquote><p>I was in those days recognised as one of the favoured
disciples of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad, and lived in the same
school in which he taught. My room adjoined his room,
and we were closely associated together. On the day that
he was engaged in discussion with Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, I overheard
their conversation from beginning to end, and was
deeply affected by the ardour, the fluency, and learning
of that youthful stranger. I was surprised at the evasive
answers, the arrogance, and contemptuous behaviour
of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad. That day I felt strongly
attracted by the charm of that youth, and deeply resented
the unseemly conduct of my teacher towards him. I
concealed my feelings, however, and pretended to ignore
his discussions with Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn. I was seized with a
passionate desire to meet the latter, and ventured, at the
hour of midnight, to visit him. He did not expect me,
but I knocked at his door, and found him awake seated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>beside his lamp. He received me affectionately, and spoke
to me with extreme courtesy and tenderness. I unburdened
my heart to him, and as I was addressing him, tears, which
I could not repress, flowed from my eyes. 'I can now see,'
he said, 'the reason why I have chosen to dwell in this
place. Your teacher has contemptuously rejected this
Message and despised its Author. My hope is that his
pupil may, unlike his master, recognise its truth. What is
your name, and which city is your home?' 'My name,' I
replied, 'is Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad, and my surname Mu`allim.
My home is N&uacute;r, in the province of M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n.' 'Tell
me,' further inquired Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, 'is there to-day
among the family of the late M&iacute;rz&aacute; Buzurg-i-N&uacute;r&iacute;, who
was so renowned for his character, his charm, and artistic
and intellectual attainments, anyone who has proved
himself capable of maintaining the high traditions of
that illustrious house?' 'Yea,' I replied, 'among his sons
now living, one has distinguished Himself by the very
traits which characterised His father. By His virtuous life,
His high attainments, His loving-kindness and liberality,
He has proved Himself a noble descendant of a noble
father.' 'What is His occupation?' he asked me. 'He
cheers the disconsolate and feeds the hungry,' I replied.
'What of His rank and position?' 'He has none,' I said,
'apart from befriending the poor and the stranger.' 'What
is His name?' '&#7716;usayn-`Al&iacute;.' 'In which of the scripts of
His father does He excel?'<a name="FNanchor_BB_54" id="FNanchor_BB_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB_54" class="fnanchor">[BB]</a> 'His favourite script is
<span class="u">sh</span>ikastih-nasta`l&iacute;q.' 'How does He spend His time?' 'He
roams the woods and delights in the beauties of the
countryside.' 'What is His age?' 'Eight and twenty.'
The eagerness with which Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn questioned me,
and the sense of delight with which he welcomed every
particular I gave him, greatly surprised me. Turning to
me, with his face beaming with satisfaction and joy, he
once more enquired: 'I presume you often meet Him?'
'I frequently visit His home,' I replied. 'Will you,' he
said, 'deliver into His hands a trust from me?' 'Most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>assuredly,' was my reply. He then gave me a scroll
wrapped in a piece of cloth, and requested me to hand it to
Him the next day at the hour of dawn. 'Should He deign
to answer me,' he added, 'will you be kind enough to
acquaint me with His reply?' I received the scroll from
him and, at break of day, arose to carry out his desire.</p>

<p>As I approached the house of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, I recognised
His brother M&iacute;rz&aacute; M&uacute;s&aacute;, who was standing at the gate,
and to whom I communicated the object of my visit. He
went into the house and soon reappeared bearing a message
of welcome. I was ushered into His presence, and
presented the scroll to M&iacute;rz&aacute; M&uacute;s&aacute;, who laid it before
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h. He bade us both be seated. Unfolding the
scroll, He glanced at its contents and began to read aloud
to us certain of its passages. I sat enraptured as I listened
to the sound of His voice and the sweetness of its melody.
He had read a page of the scroll when, turning to His
brother, He said: 'M&uacute;s&aacute;, what have you to say? Verily I
say, whoso believes in the Qur'&aacute;n and recognises its
Divine origin, and yet hesitates, though it be for a moment,
to admit that these soul-stirring words are endowed with
the same regenerating power, has most assuredly erred in
his judgment and has strayed far from the path of justice.'
He spoke no more. Dismissing me from His presence,
He charged me to take to Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, as a gift from
Him, a loaf of Russian sugar and a package of tea, and to
convey to him the expression of His appreciation and love.</p>

<p>I arose and, filled with joy, hastened back to Mull&aacute;
&#7716;usayn, and delivered to him the gift and message of
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h. With what joy and exultation he received
them from me! Words fail me to describe the intensity
of his emotion. He started to his feet, received with bowed
head the gift from my hand, and fervently kissed it. He
then took me in his arms, kissed my eyes, and said: 'My
dearly beloved friend! I pray that even as you have
rejoiced my heart, God may grant you eternal felicity
and fill your heart with imperishable gladness.' I was
amazed at the behaviour of Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn. What could be, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>thought to myself, the nature of the bond that unites
these two souls? What could have kindled so fervid a
fellowship in their hearts? Why should Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn,
in whose sight the pomp and circumstance of royalty were
the merest trifle, have evinced such gladness at the sight
of so inconsiderable a gift from the hands of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h?
I was puzzled by this thought and could not unravel
its mystery.</p>

<p>A few days later, Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn left for <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n. As
he bade me farewell, he said: 'Breathe not to anyone what
you have heard and witnessed. Let this be a secret hidden
within your breast. Divulge not His name, for they who
envy His position will arise to harm Him. In your moments
of meditation, pray that the Almighty may protect Him,
that, through Him, He may exalt the downtrodden,
enrich the poor, and redeem the fallen. The secret of
things is concealed from our eyes. Ours is the duty to
raise the call of the New Day and to proclaim this Divine
Message unto all people. Many a soul will, in this city,
shed his blood in this path. That blood will water the
Tree of God, will cause it to flourish, and to overshadow
all mankind.'<a name="Nanchor_III6" id="Nanchor_III6"></a><a
href="#Note_III6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had, the holy city that has within it the Shrine
of the eighth Im&aacute;m, Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn addressed his first letter
to the B&aacute;b. He gave, as instructed by Him, the full details of
his journey from <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z to <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n. He presented the list
of names of those who had responded to the call of the
new theophany: a list which had become further enriched
in <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n by the enrolment of M&iacute;rz&aacute; A&#7717;mad-i-Az<span class="u">gh</span>and&iacute;,
the most learned of the divines of that renowned province;
Mull&aacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-i-Fur&uacute;<span class="u">gh</span>&iacute;, another divine of
immense learning; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-B&aacute;qir-i-Q&aacute;'in&iacute;, whose
house in Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had was to gain the distinction of being known
as the B&aacute;b&iacute;yyih, since its doors would be always open to
those who sought Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn and to all the B&aacute;b&iacute;s; Mull&aacute;
A&#7717;mad-i-Mu`allim, who had been a tutor to the sons of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im; and Mull&aacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `Al&iacute;, to whom the B&aacute;b
gave the title of `A&#7827;&iacute;m (Great). But above all, Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn
recounted what had transpired in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, culminating in the
gracious response of the nobleman of N&uacute;r. He sent his letter,
again as instructed by the B&aacute;b, to &#7788;abas (a town in the province
of <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n) where agents of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;
received it and dispatched it to Yazd, whence it reached
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. The arrival of Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn's letter and the tidings
which it conveyed brought unbounded joy to the B&aacute;b.
Soon after, in the month of September, He left <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z,
accompanied by Qudd&uacute;s, and the faithful Ethiopian servant,
Mub&aacute;rak.</p>

<p>From B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr, while waiting to take the boat to Jiddah
(Jaddah), the B&aacute;b wrote His first letter to His wife. It
opens with these moving words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In the Name of God, exalted is He. My sweet love, may
God preserve thee.' 'God is my witness,' He continues, 'that
since the time of separation sorrow has been so intense that
it cannot be described,' and adds His hope that God, 'the
Lord of the world,' may 'facilitate the return journey in the
best manner.' Two days previously He had reached B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr,
and informs His wife that 'the weather is exceedingly hot,
but God, the Lord of the world, is the Protector.' The boat,
it seemed, would be sailing the same month; 'God, the Lord
of the world, will provide protection by His grace.' He had
not been able to see His mother at the time of His departure,
and asks His wife to give her His salutation (sal&aacute;m) and
request her prayers. He would write to Bombay for the
goods required. And the letter ends thus: 'God willing,
that which is decreed will come to pass. Peace be upon thee
and the mercy of God and His
blessings.'<a name="Nanchor_III7" id="Nanchor_III7"></a><a
href="#Note_III7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The ship, bearing pilgrims to Jiddah, set sail on the nineteenth
day of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n 1260&mdash;October 2nd
1844.<a name="Nanchor_III8" id="Nanchor_III8"></a><a

sent to his native place'.<a name="Nanchor_IV1" id="Nanchor_IV1"></a><a
href="#Note_IV1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Obviously Lady Sheil was confused.
She had heard of the arrest of Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;y-i-Bas&#7789;&aacute;m&iacute;
in `Ir&aacute;q and of his imprisonment. She mistook him for the
B&aacute;b.</p>

<p>Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;, as we have seen, was directed to `Ir&aacute;q by the
B&aacute;b, and took with him a copy of the <i>Qayy&uacute;mu'l-Asm&aacute;'</i>, the
commentary on the S&uacute;rih of Y&uacute;suf (Joseph). The news and
the message that he gave aroused eager interest and ready
response from his hearers. But hostile reaction was also swift.
It was Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; who, in Karbil&aacute;, informed Qurratu'l-`Ayn
of the advent of the B&aacute;b. He was not at liberty to mention
His Name. We do not know whether, in view of the fact
that Qurratu'l-`Ayn had been elevated to the high and
honoured position of a Letter of the Living, Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
her any information other than the tidings of the appearance
of the B&aacute;b. The disciples of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im were in a much
stronger position there than in Najaf, in spite of the fact
that in Karbil&aacute; they had a redoubtable opponent in the
person of Siyyid Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m-i-Qazv&iacute;n&iacute;. There in Karbil&aacute;,
Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; remained safe. But the story was different in
Najaf. Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the presence of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Mu&#7717;ammad-&#7716;asan, one of
the most celebrated ecclesiastics of <span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;`ah Isl&aacute;m, and in the
face of a distinguished company of his disciples, Mull&aacute;
`Al&iacute; announced fearlessly the manifestation of the B&aacute;b,
the Gate whose advent they were eagerly awaiting. 'His
proof,' he declared, 'is His Word; His testimony, none
other than the testimony with which Isl&aacute;m seeks to vindicate
its truth. From the pen of this unschooled H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>imite
Youth of Persia there have streamed, within the space of
forty-eight hours, as great a number of verses, of prayers,
of homilies, and scientific treatises, as would equal in
volume the whole of the Qur'&aacute;n, which it took Mu&#7717;ammad,
the Prophet of God, twenty-three years to reveal!'
That proud and fanatic leader, instead of welcoming, in an
age of darkness and prejudice, these life-giving evidences
of a new-born Revelation, forthwith pronounced Mull&aacute;
`Al&iacute; a heretic and expelled him from the assembly. His
disciples and followers, even the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute;s, who already
testified to Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;'s piety, sincerity, and learning,
endorsed, unhesitatingly, the judgment against him. The
disciples of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Mu&#7717;ammad-&#7716;asan, joining hands
with their adversaries, heaped upon him untold indignities.
They eventually delivered him, his hands bound in chains,
to an official of the Ottoman government, arraigning him
as a wrecker of Isl&aacute;m, a calumniator of the Prophet, an
instigator of mischief, a disgrace to the Faith, and worthy
of the penalty of death. He was taken to Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d under
the escort of government officials, and was cast into prison
by the governor of that city.<a name="Nanchor_IV2" id="Nanchor_IV2"></a><a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>&Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Mu&#7779;&#7789;af&aacute;y-i-Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d&iacute;,<a
name="Nanchor_IV3" id="Nanchor_IV3"></a><a href="#Note_IV3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in a short autobiography
which he wrote at the instance of M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Fa&#7693;&iacute;,
describes Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;'s arrival in `Ir&aacute;q and the events
which followed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The messenger, Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; al-Bas&#7789;&aacute;m&iacute;,<a name="FNanchor_BD_56" id="FNanchor_BD_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD_56" class="fnanchor">[BD]</a> reached K&uacute;fih
in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 1260 [<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1844] and distributed books,
treatises and tablets amongst the divines. Due to this a
body of the divines in Najaf and Karbil&aacute; were seized with
consternation. They arose in opposition and stirred themselves
to vociferous denunciation. The Government
hearing of what had transpired, became concerned lest
disorders might ensue, and deemed it politic to imprison
the messenger, confiscate the books and tablets in his
possession and send him to the seat of the province, that
is Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d. The V&aacute;l&iacute;, at that time, was Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;, the
same man who captured Karbil&aacute;....<a name="FNanchor_BE_57" id="FNanchor_BE_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE_57" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a></p>

<p>When the messenger reached Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d the V&aacute;l&iacute; kept
him in prison and placed the books and the treatises in the
council-chamber. My father, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Mu&#7717;ammad, visited
the messenger every day in the prison, and heard the Word
of God from him for three months. Whatever he heard
he imparted to those who were seekers, so that, during
this short time, a large number of people came to believe.
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ba<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;r an-Najaf&iacute; was one of them, a mujtahid
seventy-five years old. Then there were <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Sul&#7789;&aacute;n
al-Karbil&aacute;'&iacute; and a group with him in Karbil&aacute;; Siyyid
Mu&#7717;ammad-Ja`far, Siyyid &#7716;asan Ja`far, and Siyyid `Al&iacute;
Bi<span class="u">sh</span>r and a group with him in the town of K&aacute;&#7827;im&iacute;yyah;
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>ibl [the author's father], Siyyid
Mu&#7717;sin al-K&aacute;&#7827;im&iacute;, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; al-Kar&iacute;m&iacute; and a group
with them of villagers like <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `Abb&aacute;s, Mull&aacute; Ma&#7717;m&uacute;d,
`Abdu'l-H&aacute;d&iacute; and Mihd&iacute;....</p>

<p>When the Government noticed that the Cause was gaining
ground day by day, the afore-mentioned V&aacute;l&iacute;, Naj&iacute;b
P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;, ordered the divines of all the regions to come to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d....<a name="Nanchor_IV4" id="Nanchor_IV4"></a><a
href="#Note_IV4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They summoned my father, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>
Mu&#7717;ammad, to present himself. But my father left
Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d in disguise, because he had learned that the V&aacute;l&iacute;
intended to make him give witness against the Cause of
the Day of Judgment. They brought the messenger to
this terrible assembly and asked him who the Lord of
the Cause was. He answered: 'The awaited Spirit of Truth
hath come. He is the One promised in the Books of God.'
Then he read them some verses and prayers and called
upon them to believe. It went hard with them to accept
the Cause. They arose to deny and to reject it, full of
haughtiness. They agreed to denounce the messenger as
a heretic and passed the sentence of death upon him, and
thus ended that assemblage of ill omen. The V&aacute;l&iacute; sent the
account of the proceedings to the Sublime Porte, whence
came the orders that the messenger should be sent in
fetters, together with his books, to the capital. The
messenger languished for six months in the gaol of
Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d and was then dispatched to the Sublime Porte,
under escort, by way of Mosul. The fame of the Cause
was noised abroad in Mosul, and when he passed Mosul
nothing more was heard of him.<a name="Nanchor_IV5" id="Nanchor_IV5"></a><a
href="#Note_IV5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The circumstances of Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;'s arrest were also noted
by Major Henry Rawlinson,<a name="Nanchor_IV6" id="Nanchor_IV6"></a><a
href="#Note_IV6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> then British Political Agent in
Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d, who, on January 8th 1845, reported to Sir Stratford
Canning, the Ambassador in Istanbul:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have the honor to report for Your Excellency's
information the following circumstances which are at
present causing much excitement at this place, and which
threaten in their consequences to give rise to renewed
misunderstanding between the Persian &amp; Turkish Govts.</p>

<p>About three months ago, an inferior priest of Shiraz
appeared in Kerbela, bearing a copy of the Koran, which
he stated to have been delivered to him, by the forerunner
of the Imam Mehdi, to be exhibited in token of
his approaching advent. The book proved on examination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>to have been altered and interpolated in many essential
passages, the object being, to prepare the Mohammedan
world for the immediate manifestation of the Imam, and
to identify the individual to whom the emendations of
the text were declared to have been revealed, as his inspired
&amp; true precursor. It was in consequence pronounced
by a part of the Sheeah divines at Nejef and
Kerbela, to be a blasphemous production, and the priest
of Shiraz was warned by them of the danger; which he
incurred in giving currency to its contents&mdash;but a considerable
section nevertheless of the Sheeahs of Nejef,
who under the name of <i>Us&uacute;l&iacute;</i>, or 'Transcendentalists', have
lately risen into notice as the disciples of the High Priest
Sheikh Kazem, and who are in avowed expectation of the
speedy advent of the Imam, adopted the proposed
readings, and declared themselves ready to join the
Precursor; as soon as he should appear amongst them&mdash;These
parties owing to local dissensions, were shortly
afterwards denounced to the Govt. by the orthodox
Sheeas as heretics, and attention being thus drawn to the
perverted copy of the Koran, upon which they rested their
belief, the volume was seized &amp; its bearer being brought
to Bagdad, was cast into prison, as a blasphemer against
Islam and a disturber of the public peace.<a name="FNanchor_BF_58"
id="FNanchor_BF_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF_58" class="fnanchor">
[BF]</a><a name="Nanchor_IV7" id="Nanchor_IV7"></a><a
href="#Note_IV7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; was the first martyr of the B&aacute;b&iacute; Faith. Though
his arrest and sufferings lasted only a few months, he was
the centre of conjecture, the subject of official report, and
the cause of increased rancour between the Sunn&iacute; and <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah
sects, and the Ottoman and Iranian governments. European
officials who were drawn into this obscure drama
included Major Rawlinson, who submitted frequent and
lengthy reports to Sir Stratford Canning in Istanbul and
Lt.-Col. Sheil in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, and received their advice and
instructions; M. de Titow, Russian envoy in Istanbul who
joined Canning in urging the Sublime Porte to restrain
Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; from putting 'the Persian Priest' to death, and
instead to inflict on him only 'the mildest punishment
consistent with the public tranquillity'; and Lord Aberdeen,
the British Foreign Secretary in London, who was
apprised of the final outcome.</p>

<p>Although the dispatches of Major Rawlinson are in
certain aspects subject to grave reservations, for his knowledge
was sometimes meagre and at second hand, even
inaccurate, they do portray the agitation, confusion and
opposition created by the claim of the B&aacute;b and the teaching
of Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;. Thus he wrote to Canning:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Soonnee Priesthood have taken up the case in a
rancorous spirit of bigotry, and their inveteracy has
enlisted the sympathies of the entire Sheeah sect, in
favor of the imprisoned Persian ... the question has
now become one of virulent contest, between the Soonee
&amp; Sheeah sects, or which is the same thing in this part
of the Ottoman Empire, between the Turkish &amp; Persian
population....<a name="Nanchor_IV8" id="Nanchor_IV8"></a><a
href="#Note_IV8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was the Governor (V&aacute;l&iacute;) of Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d, Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;, who
bore the responsibility of controlling these passions;
but being himself a fanatical Sunn&iacute;, he was resolved that
the <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ahs should submit to the Sunn&iacute; authority, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
determined to bar any intrusions of the Persians into the
affairs of his P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;lik.<a name="FNanchor_BG_59" id="FNanchor_BG_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_BG_59" class="fnanchor">[BG]</a> Nevertheless, as reported by
Rawlinson:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nejib Pasha at the same time, to give all due formality
to his proceedings, and to divest the affair of the
appearance of mere sectarian persecution, has brought in
the chief Priests from Nejef &amp; Kerbela, to hold a solemn
Court of Inquisition in conjunction with the heads of the
Soonnee religion in Bagdad, but I do not anticipate
much benefit from this compulsory &amp; most unwilling
attendance of the former parties&mdash;They will probably
make an effort to save the life of their unfortunate
countryman, proposing the banishment of the messenger
and of the heads of the <i>Us&uacute;l&iacute;</i> sect, as the simplest method
of suppressing the heresy, but they will be intimidated
&amp; overruled....<a name="Nanchor_IV9" id="Nanchor_IV9"></a><a
href="#Note_IV9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, such an unwieldy court of Sunn&iacute; and <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah divines
could come to no agreement about Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;'s punishment.
On January 16th 1845, Rawlinson wrote to Sheil,
in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Court of Inquisition convened for the trial of the
Persian priest, was held on Monday last [January 13th],
H.E. Nejib Pasha presiding, and Moola Abdool Azeez
being also present, to afford his countenance to the
accused&mdash;The perverted copy of the Koran being produced
in Court, was unanimously condemned as a
blasphemous production, and parties avowing a belief
in the readings which it continued [sic], were declared to
be liable to the punishment of death&mdash;It was then argued
whether or not the Shirazee had thus avowed his belief
in a blasphemous production&mdash;he himself distinctly
repudiated the charge, and although witnesses were
brought forward, who stated that he had in their presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>declared his adoption of the spurious text, of which he
was the bearer, yet as there was reason to suspect the
fidelity of their evidence, the Sheeah divines were disposed
to give him the benefit of his present disavowal&mdash;After
much discussion the Soonee law-officers adjudged
the culprit to be convicted of blasphemy &amp; passed sentence
of death on him accordingly, while the Sheeahs
returned a verdict, that he was only guilty of the dissemination
of blasphemy, &amp; liable in consequence to
no heavier punishment than imprisonment or banishment....</p></blockquote>

<p>To this Rawlinson added:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I understand that considerable uneasiness is beginning
to display itself at Kerbela &amp; Nejef, in regard to the expected
manifestation of the Imam, and I am apprehensive
that the measures now in progress will rather increase
than allay the excitement.<a name="FNanchor_BH_60" id="FNanchor_BH_60">
</a><a href="#Footnote_BH_60" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a><a
name="Nanchor_IV10" id="Nanchor_IV10"></a><a
href="#Note_IV10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>The personal intervention of Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; had served also
to influence the course of events in another way. By referring
the matter to the Sublime Porte, he prevented the
extradition of the Persian prisoner to his native land, as
requested by the Iranian Prime Minister, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;.</p>

<p>A similar request for the transfer of Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; to Persian
jurisdiction was made to Major Rawlinson by the Governor
of Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h, Mu&#7717;ibb-`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, for, as he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the first place it is improper to arrest and imprison
anyone on a mere accusation, which may be true or false,&mdash;and
in the second place, supposing that he (the Shir&aacute;zee)
were guilty; as a subject of the exalted Govt. of Persia,
he ought not to be subject to arrest&mdash;if his crime were
proved, his punishment should be that of banishment
from the Turkish territory&mdash;I have therefore considered
it necessary to represent this matter to you my friend, and
to request that, as a well wisher to the preservation of
friendship between the two Governments, You will
communicate with H. Excy. Nejib Pasha on the subject,
and will suggest to him, that if the guilt of the Persian
be fully substantiated, he may be sent to Kermanshah, in
order that I may transfer him to Tehran for punishment&mdash;and
if on the other hand, the accusations against him
prove to be malicious and without foundation, he may be
at once released and set at liberty.</p>

<p>Under any circumstances his continued imprisonment
is unbecoming and contrary (to custom).<a name="Nanchor_IV11"
id="Nanchor_IV11"></a><a href="#Note_IV11" class="fnanchor">[11]
</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This request was duly submitted by Rawlinson to Naj&iacute;b
P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; but, as the Governor had already referred the matter
to the Sublime Porte after the religious court's examination,
the prisoner remained in Turkish custody.</p>

<p>It was on April 15th that Rawlinson reported to Canning
that 'Nejib Pasha received orders by yesterday's post to
transmit to Constantinople the Persian priest who has been
in confinement for the last 3 months at Bagdad.... His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Excy. is preparing to obey these instructions with all
available despatch.' He also says in the same letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... [the] more in fact these Mujtiheds<a name="FNanchor_BI_61" id="FNanchor_BI_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_BI_61" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a> are degraded
by the Turkish Govt., the more complete, I think, will
be their ascendancy over the minds of their disciples and
the only results, therefore, which are likely to attend the
proscription of their public duties, are the more complete
isolation of the Persian community of this province, and
an increase of the rancorous feeling with which the
dominant Soonee party is regarded&mdash;<a name="Nanchor_IV12"
id="Nanchor_IV12"></a><a href="#Note_IV12" class="fnanchor">[12]
</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On the last day of April, Rawlinson wrote once more to
Canning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I take this opportunity of reporting that the Persian
priest of Shiraz so long detained in confinement at this
place, was sent a prisoner to Constantinople in company
with the Tartar<a name="FNanchor_BJ_62" id="FNanchor_BJ_62"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BJ_62" class="fnanchor">[BJ]</a> who conveyed
the last Bagdad post.<a name="Nanchor_IV13" id="Nanchor_IV13"></a><a
href="#Note_IV13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, as early as February, Major Rawlinson came
to an erroneous conclusion about the B&aacute;b, which subsequent
events belied. He wrote to Canning on the 18th:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... the excitement which has been for some time prevalent
in this vicinity among the Sheeah sect in connection with
the expected manifestation of the Imam Mehdi, is beginning
gradually to subside, the impostor who personated
the character of the forerunner of the Imam ... having
been deterred by a sense of personal danger from a further
prosecution of the agitation, which he set on foot at
Kerbela in the Autumn on his passage from Persia to
Mecca.<a name="Nanchor_IV14" id="Nanchor_IV14"></a><a
href="#Note_IV14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>He was also in error in stating to Sheil, ten days later, that
'the impostor ... joined as a private individual the Caravan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of pilgrims which is travelling to Persia by the route of
Damascus and Aleppo'.<a name="Nanchor_IV15" id="Nanchor_IV15"></a><a
href="#Note_IV15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In considering this episode of the arrest, imprisonment and
banishment of the first B&aacute;b&iacute; martyr, there are four aspects
which deserve special note. First is the fact that while the
B&aacute;b&iacute;s in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z were being punished by &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n,
Governor of the province of F&aacute;rs,<a name="FNanchor_BK_63" id="FNanchor_BK_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_BK_63" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a> the Persian Government
was trying to rescue Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; in Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d. Secondly,
whereas the <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah divines were demanding a light punishment,
the Sunn&iacute;s were clamouring for the death penalty. A
third point, important to students of the B&aacute;b&iacute; Faith, is that
from the earliest stage of its history rumours and misinformation
about the B&aacute;b abounded. It is also of considerable
interest that this episode was reported to Lord Aberdeen,
the British Foreign Secretary in London.</p>

<p>As to Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;, what precisely happened to him, how
and where he died and where he was interred, have all
remained mysteries. It has been said that he died in the
prison of Kark&uacute;k, but no definite proof exists. He was the
first of the concourse of martyrs whose numbers were soon
to swell into hundreds and thousands.</p>

<p>The B&aacute;b embarked for Jiddah, probably on an Arab sailing-boat
named <i>Fut&uacute;&#7717;-ar-Ras&uacute;l</i>&mdash;Victories of the Messenger. If
so, He had as fellow-passenger a maternal uncle of Mu&#7717;ammad
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, Mu&#7717;ammad-B&aacute;qir <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the Biglarbag&iacute;<a name="FNanchor_BL_64" id="FNanchor_BL_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_BL_64" class="fnanchor">[BL]</a> of
&#7788;ihr&aacute;n, who was attended by <span class="u">Sh</span>ukru'll&aacute;h <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-N&uacute;r&iacute;, a
prominent official of the province of F&aacute;rs. We know for
certain that two of His fellow-townsmen on the boat were
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Abu'l-&#7716;asan, who pursued the same trade as the B&aacute;b's
father, and <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>im, brother of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-Tur&aacute;b,
the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. The former was captivated
by the charm and the sublime bearing of his compatriot,
the young Siyyid of whose claim he was unaware,
and gave Him his allegiance without the slightest hesitation
when he learned of His claim. <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>im, however,
was already jealous of the respect commanded by the
B&aacute;b and became His implacable enemy, even though his
brother, the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih, served the interests of the B&aacute;b
to the best of his ability.<a name="Nanchor_V1" id="Nanchor_V1"></a><a
href="#Note_V1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Abu'l-&#7716;asan has related<a name="Nanchor_V2"
id="Nanchor_V2"></a><a href="#Note_V2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that during the voyage
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>im became daily more arrogant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
quarrelsome, molesting the passengers and making the
young Siyyid a particular target for his invective. When the
Arab captain could no longer tolerate his insolent behaviour,
he ordered him to be seized and thrown into the sea.
According to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Abu'l-&#7716;asan, it was the B&aacute;b who stepped
forward to intercede for him. However, the captain was
determined to be rid of the troublesome <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>. And when
the B&aacute;b noticed that the sailors were about to throw <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>
Ab&uacute;-H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>im overboard, He hurled Himself upon him,
caught hold of him and earnestly requested the captain to
pardon the wrong-doer. The Arab captain was astonished,
because it had been the young Siyyid who had suffered most
from the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>'s malice. But the B&aacute;b replied that, since
people who behaved in that manner harmed only themselves,
one should be tolerant and forgiving.</p>

<p>The rites of the &#7716;ajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) are to be
performed on the ninth and tenth days of the month of
<span class="u">Dh</span>i'l-&#7716;ijjah, the last month of the Muslim lunar year. On
the tenth day the `&Iacute;d-al-A&#7693;&#7717;&aacute; (the Festival of Sacrifices)
is celebrated throughout the Muslim world.<a name="FNanchor_BM_65" id="FNanchor_BM_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_BM_65" class="fnanchor">[BM]</a> It commemorates
the sacrifice offered by Abraham of His son.
Whenever the `&Iacute;d-al-A&#7693;&#7717;&aacute; falls on a Friday, the &#7716;ajj of that
year is termed the &#7716;ajj-i-Akbar (the Greatest &#7716;ajj). In the
year 1260, the tenth of <span class="u">Dh</span>i'l-&#7716;ijjah was a Friday (December
20th 1844), and therefore the number of pilgrims was
commensurately greater. An Islamic tradition points to the
appearance of the Q&aacute;'im in a year of the &#7716;ajj-i-Akbar.</p>

<p>Another particularly notable pilgrim in that year 1260
was a divine of high repute, Siyyid Ja`far-i-Ka<span class="u">sh</span>f&iacute;, whose
son Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; (later known as Va&#7717;&iacute;d) was to become one
of the most distinguished followers of the B&aacute;b.</p>

<p>The journey to Jiddah was long, tedious and exhausting.
Seas were rough and storms frequent. An Arab sailing-boat
did not afford much comfort. 'For days we suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
from the scarcity of water. I had to content myself with the
juice of sweet lemon,' the B&aacute;b writes in the Persian
<i>Bay&aacute;n</i>.<a name="Nanchor_V3" id="Nanchor_V3"></a><a
href="#Note_V3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Abu'l-&#7716;asan recounts:</p>

<blockquote><p>During the entire period of approximately two months,
from the day we embarked at B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr to the day when we
landed at Jaddih, the port of &#7716;ij&aacute;z, whenever by day or
night I chanced to meet either the B&aacute;b or Qudd&uacute;s, I
invariably found them together, both absorbed in their
work. The B&aacute;b seemed to be dictating, and Qudd&uacute;s
was busily engaged in taking down whatever fell from
His lips. Even at a time when panic seemed to have seized
the passengers of that storm-tossed vessel, they would be
seen pursuing their labours with unperturbed confidence
and calm. Neither the violence of the elements nor the
tumult of the people around them could either ruffle the
serenity of their countenance or turn them from their
purpose.<a name="Nanchor_V4" id="Nanchor_V4"></a><a
href="#Note_V4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At Jiddah the B&aacute;b and His companions put on the i&#7717;r&aacute;m,<a name="FNanchor_BN_66" id="FNanchor_BN_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_BN_66" class="fnanchor">[BN]</a>
the garb of the pilgrim. He travelled to Mecca on a camel,
but Qudd&uacute;s would not mount and walked all the way,
keeping pace with it. On the tenth day of <span class="u">Dh</span>i'l-&#7716;ijjah the
B&aacute;b offered the prescribed sacrifice. The meat of the nineteen
lambs which He bought was all given to the poor and
the needy; nine of the animals were sacrificed on His own
behalf, seven on behalf of Qudd&uacute;s and three for
Mub&aacute;rak.<a name="Nanchor_V5" id="Nanchor_V5"></a><a
href="#Note_V5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h-i-Afn&aacute;n, quoting &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Abu'l-&#7716;asan,
relates in his chronicle that after the completion of
the rites of the &#7716;ajj, at a time when the court of the House of
Ka`bah and the roofs of adjoining houses teemed with
pilgrims, the B&aacute;b stood against the structure of the Ka`bah,
laid hold of the ring on its door and thrice repeated, in a
clear voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am that Q&aacute;'im whose advent you have been awaiting.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Abu'l-&#7716;asan recalled, many years later, that a sudden
hush fell upon the audience. The full implication of those
momentous words must, at the time, have eluded that vast
concourse of people. But the news of the claim of the young
Siyyid soon spread in an ever-widening circle.</p>

<p>One day in Mecca, the B&aacute;b came face to face with M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-&#7716;usayn-i-Kirm&aacute;n&iacute;, known as Mu&#7717;&iacute;&#7789;.<a name="FNanchor_BO_67" id="FNanchor_BO_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_BO_67" class="fnanchor">[BO]</a> They
happened to meet close by the sacred Black Stone (&#7716;ajar
al-Aswad). The B&aacute;b took Mu&#7717;&iacute;&#7789;'s hand, saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>O Mu&#7717;&iacute;&#7789;! You regard yourself as one of the most outstanding
figures of the <span class="u">sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute; community and a distinguished
exponent of its teachings. In your heart you even
claim to be one of the direct successors and rightful
inheritors of those twin great Lights, those Stars that have
heralded the morn of Divine guidance. Behold, we are
both now standing within this most sacred shrine. Within
its hallowed precincts, He whose Spirit dwells in this
place can cause Truth immediately to be known and
distinguished from falsehood, and righteousness from
error. Verily I declare, none besides Me in this day,
whether in the East or in the West, can claim to be the
Gate that leads men to the knowledge of God. My proof
is none other than that proof whereby the truth of the
Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad was established. Ask Me whatsoever
you please; now, at this very moment, I pledge Myself
to reveal such verses as can demonstrate the truth of My
mission. You must choose either to submit yourself
unreservedly to My Cause or to repudiate it entirely. You
have no other alternative. If you choose to reject My
message, I will not let go your hand until you pledge your
word to declare publicly your repudiation of the Truth
which I have proclaimed. Thus shall He who speaks the
Truth be made known, and he that speaks falsely shall be
condemned to eternal misery and shame. Then shall the
way of Truth be revealed and made manifest to all men.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>Mu&#7717;&iacute;&#7789; was taken by surprise and was overwhelmed. He
replied to the B&aacute;b:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My Lord, my Master! Ever since the day on which my
eyes beheld You in Karbil&aacute;, I seemed at last to have found
and recognised Him who had been the object of my
quest. I renounce whosoever has failed to recognise
You, and despise him in whose heart may yet linger the
faintest misgivings as to Your purity and holiness. I
pray You to overlook my weakness, and entreat You to
answer me in my perplexity. Please God I may, at this
very place, within the precincts of this hallowed shrine,
swear my fealty to You, and arise for the triumph of Your
Cause. If I be insincere in what I declare, if in my heart I
should disbelieve what my lips proclaim, I would deem
myself utterly unworthy of the grace of the Prophet of
God, and regard my action as an act of manifest disloyalty
to `Al&iacute;, His chosen successor.</p></blockquote>

<p>The B&aacute;b knew how vacillating Mu&#7717;&iacute;&#7789; was, and answered:</p>

<blockquote><p>Verily I say, the Truth is even now known and distinguished
from falsehood. O shrine of the Prophet of God,
and you, O Qudd&uacute;s, who have believed in Me! I take
you both, in this hour, as My witnesses. You have seen
and heard that which has come to pass between Me and
him. I call upon you to testify thereunto, and God, verily,
is, beyond and above you, My sure and ultimate Witness.
He is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
O Mu&#7717;&iacute;&#7789;! Set forth whatsoever perplexes your mind, and
I will, by the aid of God, unloose My tongue and undertake
to resolve your problems, so that you may testify to
the excellence of My utterance and realise that no one
besides Me is able to manifest My wisdom.<a name="Nanchor_V6"
id="Nanchor_V6"></a><a href="#Note_V6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Mu&#7717;&iacute;&#7789; presented his questions and then departed hurriedly
for Medina. The B&aacute;b, in answer to them, revealed the <i>&#7778;a&#7717;&iacute;fiy-i-Baynu'l-&#7716;aramayn</i>,
which, as its name 'The Epistle Between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the Two Shrines' indicates, was composed on the road to the
city of the Prophet (Medina). Mu&#7717;&iacute;&#7789;, contrary to his promise,
did not remain long in Medina, but received the B&aacute;b's
treatise in Karbil&aacute;. To the end of his days, Mu&#7717;&iacute;&#7789; was shifty
and irresolute, and the headship of the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute; community
did not go to him, but to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Kar&iacute;m <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-Kirm&aacute;n&iacute;.</p>

<p>The last act of the B&aacute;b in Mecca was to address a Tablet
to the <span class="u">Sh</span>ar&iacute;f (Sherif) of Mecca, in which He proclaimed His
advent and His Divine mandate. Qudd&uacute;s delivered it together
with a volume of the Writings of the B&aacute;b. But the
<span class="u">Sh</span>ar&iacute;f was preoccupied and ignored the communication
put in his hands. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; N&iacute;y&aacute;z-i-Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d&iacute; recounts:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the year 1267 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> [<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1850-51], I undertook a
pilgrimage to that holy city, where I was privileged to
meet the Sherif. In the course of his conversation with
me, he said: 'I recollect that in the year '60, during the
season of pilgrimage, a youth came to visit me. He
presented to me a sealed book which I readily accepted
but was too much occupied at that time to read. A few days
later I met again that same youth, who asked me whether
I had any reply to make to his offer. Pressure of work had
again detained me from considering the contents of that
book. I was therefore unable to give him a satisfactory
reply. When the season of pilgrimage was over, one day,
as I was sorting out my letters, my eyes fell accidentally
upon that book. I opened it and found, in its introductory
pages, a moving and exquisitely written homily which was
followed by verses the tone and language of which bore
a striking resemblance to the Qur'&aacute;n. All that I gathered
from the perusal of the book was that among the people of
Persia a man of the seed of F&aacute;&#7789;imih and descendant of
the family of H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>im, had raised a new call, and was
announcing to all people the appearance of the promised
Q&aacute;'im. I remained, however, ignorant of the name of
the author of that book, nor was I informed of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>circumstances attending that call.' 'A great commotion,'
I remarked, 'has indeed seized that land during the last
few years. A Youth, a descendant of the Prophet and a
merchant by profession, has claimed that His utterance
was the Voice of Divine inspiration. He has publicly
asserted that, within the space of a few days, there could
stream from His tongue verses of such number and excellence
as would surpass in volume and beauty the
Qur'&aacute;n itself&mdash;a work which it took Mu&#7717;ammad no less
than twenty-three years to reveal. A multitude of people,
both high and low, civil and ecclesiastical, among the
inhabitants of Persia, have rallied round His standard
and have willingly sacrificed themselves in His path.
That Youth has, during the past year, in the last days of
the month of <span class="u">Sh</span>a`b&aacute;n [July 1850], suffered martyrdom
in Tabr&iacute;z, in the province of &Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>irb&aacute;yj&aacute;n. They who
persecuted Him sought by this means to extinguish the
light which He kindled in that land. Since His martyrdom,
however, His influence has pervaded all classes of people.'
The Sherif, who was listening attentively, expressed his
indignation at the behaviour of those who had persecuted
the B&aacute;b. 'The malediction of God be upon these evil
people,' he exclaimed, 'a people who, in days past,
treated in the same manner our holy and illustrious
ancestors!' With these words the Sherif concluded his
conversation with me.<a name="Nanchor_V7" id="Nanchor_V7"></a><a
href="#Note_V7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The B&aacute;b reached Medina on the first day of the year
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 1261: Friday, January 10th
1845.<a name="Nanchor_V8" id="Nanchor_V8"></a><a href="#Note_V8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It was the first of
Mu&#7717;arram and the day of His birth. From Medina He proceeded
to Jiddah, where He took a boat bound for the port
of B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr.</p>

<p>The London <i>Times</i> of Wednesday, November 19th 1845,
carried this item of news on its third page, taken from the
<i>Literary Gazette</i> of the preceding Saturday:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mahometan Schism.</span>&mdash;A new sect has lately set itself
up in Persia, at the head of which is a merchant who had
returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca, and proclaimed
himself a successor of the Prophet. The way they treat
such matters at Shiraz appears in the following account
(June 23):&mdash;Four persons being heard repeating their
profession of faith according to the form prescribed by
the impostor, were apprehended, tried, and found guilty
of unpardonable blasphemy. They were sentenced to lose
their beards by fire being set to them. The sentence was
put into execution with all the zeal and fanaticism
becoming a true believer in Mahomet. Not deeming
the loss of beards a sufficient punishment, they were
further sentenced the next day, to have their faces blacked
and exposed through the city. Each of them was led by a
mirgazah<a name="FNanchor_BP_68" id="FNanchor_BP_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_BP_68" class="fnanchor">[BP]</a> (executioner), who had made a hole in his
nose and passed through it a string, which he sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>pulled with such violence that the unfortunate fellows
cried out alternately for mercy from the executioner and
for vengeance from Heaven. It is the custom in Persia
on such occasions for the executioners to collect money
from the spectators, and particularly from the shopkeepers
in the bazaar. In the evening when the pockets
of the executioners were well filled with money, they led
the unfortunate fellows to the city gate, and there turned
them adrift. After which the mollahs at Shiraz sent men
to Bushire, with power to seize the impostor, and take
him to Shiraz, where, on being tried, he very wisely denied
the charge of apostacy laid against him, and thus escaped
from punishment.</p></blockquote>

<p>An American quarterly, the <i>Eclectic Magazine of Foreign
Literature, Science, and Art</i>,<a name="Nanchor_VI1" id="Nanchor_VI1"></a><a
href="#Note_VI1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in its issue of January-April
1846, reproduced the same item of news which was again
taken in full from the <i>Literary Gazette</i> of London. As far
as is known, these were the earliest references to the Faith
of the B&aacute;b in any Western publication. British merchants,
who then happened to be in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, were responsible for
that report, which, as we shall see, although correct in its
essentials, was not devoid of error.</p>

<p>The B&aacute;b, returning from His pilgrimage to Mecca,
arrived at B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr sometime in the month of &#7778;afar 1261 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span>
(February-March 1845). There He parted from Qudd&uacute;s,
saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The days of your companionship with Me are drawing to
a close. The hour of separation has struck, a separation
which no reunion will follow except in the Kingdom of
God, in the presence of the King of Glory.<a name="Nanchor_VI2" id="Nanchor_VI2"></a><a
href="#Note_VI2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Qudd&uacute;s left for <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z and took with him a letter from the
B&aacute;b addressed to His uncle, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;. Meeting
Qudd&uacute;s and hearing all he had to impart convinced &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute; of the truth of the Cause of his Nephew, and
he immediately pledged Him his unqualified allegiance.</p>

<p>Mull&aacute; &#7778;&aacute;diq-i-Muqaddas now reached <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, accompanied
by Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;-Akbar-i-Ardist&aacute;n&iacute;, who had once been
his pupil in I&#7779;fah&aacute;n. Mull&aacute; &#7778;&aacute;diq established himself in a
mosque known as B&aacute;qir-&Aacute;b&aacute;d, where he led the congregation
in prayer. But as soon as he received a Tablet from the
B&aacute;b, sent from B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr, he moved to the mosque adjoining
His house. There he carried out the specific instruction of
the B&aacute;b to include in the traditional Islamic Call to Prayer&mdash;the
A<span class="u">dh</span>&aacute;n&mdash;these additional words: 'I bear witness that He
whose name is `Al&iacute; Qabl-i-Mu&#7717;ammad [`Al&iacute; preceding
Mu&#7717;ammad, the B&aacute;b] is the servant of Baq&iacute;yyatu'll&aacute;h
[the Remnant of God, Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h].'<a name="Nanchor_VI3"
id="Nanchor_VI3"></a><a href="#Note_VI3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Then the storm broke. <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>im, notorious
for his behaviour on the pilgrim boat, had already written
to his compatriots in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z to arouse their fury. Now the
divines of that city, led by <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;usayn-i-`Arab,<a name="FNanchor_BQ_69" id="FNanchor_BQ_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_BQ_69" class="fnanchor">[BQ]</a> &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Mihd&iacute;y-i-Kuj&uacute;r&iacute; and Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;y-i-Ma&#7717;all&aacute;t&iacute;,
were demanding blood. Qudd&uacute;s, Muqaddas and
Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;-Akbar were arrested, hauled before the Governor-General,
and mercilessly beaten, after which they suffered
the punishments and indignities described in the London
report already quoted (see p. <a href="#Page_76">76</a>). But there were three of
them, not four.<a name="FNanchor_BR_70" id="FNanchor_BR_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_BR_70" class="fnanchor">[BR]</a></p>

<p>The Governor-General of the province of F&aacute;rs was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>&#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, who was called &Aacute;j&uacute;d&aacute;n-B&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute; (the adjutant-major),
and had also the titles of &#7778;&aacute;&#7717;ib-I<span class="u">kh</span>t&iacute;y&aacute;r and
Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu'd-Dawlih. &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n was a native of Mar&aacute;<span class="u">gh</span>ih
in &Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>arb&aacute;yj&aacute;n, and had served as Persian envoy both to
London and Paris. In London, in June 1839, Lord Palmerston
was at first inclined not to meet him, but then decided
to receive him unofficially. At that time relations between
Britain and &Iacute;r&aacute;n had reached a low point. Captain Hennell,
the British Political Agent, had been forced to withdraw
from B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr, and at the same time a British naval force
had occupied the island of <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;rg (Karrack). Palmerston
thundered at &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n: 'Had the Admiral on arriving
on board turned his guns upon the town [B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr] and
knocked it about their ears, in my opinion he would have
been justified in so doing'.<a name="Nanchor_VI4" id="Nanchor_VI4"></a><a
href="#Note_VI4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> When the envoy returned home,
Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h was so displeased that he had him severely
bastinadoed. Nor had &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n's mission to France, it
would seem, been any more successful, although some obscurity
surrounds his dealings with the French. In Paris
he engaged a number of officers to train the Persian army,
and there were irregularities in the matter of their travelling
expenses. But more serious issues were involved, which are
described by Sir Henry Layard<a name="FNanchor_BS_71" id="FNanchor_BS_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_BS_71" class="fnanchor">[BS]</a> in the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>M. Bor&eacute;,<a name="FNanchor_BT_72" id="FNanchor_BT_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_BT_72" class="fnanchor">[BT]</a> with all his learning and enlightenment,
was a religious fanatic and profoundly intolerant of
heretics. After residing with him for a fortnight, and
having been treated by him with great kindness and hospitality,
I found myself compelled, to my great sorrow, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>leave his house [in 1840] under the following circumstances.
The Embassy which the King of the French<a name="FNanchor_BU_73" id="FNanchor_BU_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_BU_73" class="fnanchor">[BU]</a> had
sent to the Shah had not succeeded in obtaining the object
of its mission, and had left Persia much irritated at its
failure, which was mainly attributed by it and the French
Government to English intrigues. The truth was, I
believe, that they had been duped by Hussein Khan, who
had been sent as ambassador to Paris. The subject was an
unpleasant one for me to discuss, and I avoided it in
conversation with my host. One day, however, at dinner,
it was raised by M. Flandin,<a name="Nanchor_VI5" id="Nanchor_VI5"></a><a
href="#Note_VI5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the French artist, who
denounced my country and countrymen in very offensive
terms, M. Bor&eacute; himself joining in the abuse. They
accused the English Government and English agents of
having had recourse to poison to prevent Frenchmen from
establishing themselves and gaining influence in Persia,
and of having actually engaged assassins to murder
M. Outray, when on his way on a diplomatic mission to
Tehran. I denied, with indignation, these ridiculous and
calumnious charges, and high words having ensued, I
moved from M. Bor&eacute;'s house to a ruined building occupied
by Mr. Burgess.<a name="FNanchor_BV_74" id="FNanchor_BV_74"></a><a
href="#Footnote_BV_74" class="fnanchor">[BV]</a><a name="Nanchor_VI6"
id="Nanchor_VI6"></a><a href="#Note_VI6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Failure in London and tortuosity in Paris did not commend
themselves to Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h; and so, for the next
few years, &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n lived under a cloud. But in 1845 we
find him riding high in the province of F&aacute;rs. He had been
given that governorship because he was reputed to be a man
stern in his judgments, and F&aacute;rs needed an iron hand.</p>

<p>Indeed F&aacute;rs had been in a terrifying plight. The people of
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, high and low alike, had effectively played cat and
mouse with the governors sent from &#7788;ihr&aacute;n to rule over
them. Firayd&uacute;n M&iacute;rz&aacute;, the Farm&aacute;n-Farm&aacute;, Mu&#7717;ammad
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h's own brother, much favoured by &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and much detested by the <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z&iacute;s, was ousted by a combination
of the grandees and the mob.</p>

<p>M&iacute;rz&aacute; Nab&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-Qazv&iacute;n&iacute;, the
Am&iacute;r-i-D&iacute;v&aacute;n,<a name="Nanchor_VI7"
id="Nanchor_VI7"></a><a href="#Note_VI7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was also
forced out, not once, but twice. On the second occasion
many leading citizens&mdash;headed by &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Qav&aacute;mu'l-Mulk<a
name="Nanchor_VI8" id="Nanchor_VI8"></a><a href="#Note_VI8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
Mu&#7717;ammad-Qul&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-&Iacute;lbag&iacute;, a powerful chieftain of the
Qa<span class="u">sh</span>q&aacute;'&iacute; tribe&mdash;went to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, to demand the reinstatement
of Firayd&uacute;n M&iacute;rz&aacute;, whom they had previously challenged
and maligned. Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h kept them waiting in the
capital. M&iacute;rz&aacute; Ri&#7693;&aacute; (Meerza Reza), the acting British Agent
in Sh&iacute;r&aacute;z, reported on August 7th 1844 to Captain Hennell
in B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr:</p>

<blockquote><p>On the Evening of the 11th Rajab [July 28th] one of the
King's Chapurs [couriers] arrived at Shiraz, bringing
two Royal Firmans [edicts] which had been issued at the
instance of His Excellency Colonel Sheil, to be published
at Shiraz and Bushire....</p>

<p>One day the people, consisting of the principal and
respectable Inhabitants and Merchants, were assembled in
the Mosque, in order to hear the Firman from the Pulpit,
when the turbulent and evil [sic] disposed tumultuously
rushed in to prevent its being read, because addressed to
the Ameer [Am&iacute;r, the Governor]; These were of the
followers of the Hajee Kuwaum [&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Qav&aacute;m]. The Ameer
then gave the Shiraz Firman into the hands of Resheed
Khan, Surteep [Ra<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;d <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-Sart&iacute;p], who took it to the
New Mosque in the Naamutee [Ni`mat&iacute;-<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;nih]
Quarter,<a name="Nanchor_VI9" id="Nanchor_VI9"></a><a
href="#Note_VI9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
where it was published from the Reading Desks to the
assembled Moollahs, respectable Inhabitants, and Merchants.</p>

<p>On the following day when the Ameer directed that the
Firman should be read in the Dewan Khaneh [D&iacute;v&aacute;n-<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;nih&mdash;the
Court], the rioters fully armed again rushed
in impetuously. Syed Hussein Khan and Resheed Khan
then assembled their followers and topchees [t&uacute;p<span class="u">ch</span>&iacute;:
gunner], and complaining bitterly, requested permission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>to meet them ... nor was it without difficulty and much
persuasion that the Ameer could induce them to desist
pending instructions from the Capital.</p>

<p>The several Quarters of Shiraz are for the most part at
feud&mdash;Thieving and disturbance are on the increase&mdash;The
Ameer has not been dismissed nor has a new Governor
been appointed.<a name="Nanchor_VI10" id="Nanchor_VI10"></a><a
href="#Note_VI10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And matters went from bad to worse. M&iacute;rz&aacute; Ri&#7693;&aacute;'s
report to his chief, the following November 24th, was one
long catalogue of woes, not totally devoid of amusing
points:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Last Friday, from the ten Quarters of Hyedree [&#7716;aydar&iacute;]
and Naamutte [Ni`mat&iacute;] a Mob and Crowd was again
collected in the open plain, which has ever been the
scene of their conflicts, for the purpose of fighting. From
Midday to Sunset they fought with slings and stones,
sticks and arms.... As Meerza Mahomed Ali, the
secretary of Hajee Kuwam [&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Qav&aacute;m], a fine intelligent
youth, was leaving his dwelling about midday
upon some business, a drunken lootee,<a name="FNanchor_BW_75" id="FNanchor_BW_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_BW_75" class="fnanchor">[BW]</a> without reason
or previous quarrel, plunged a dagger into his right side
... two cousins, both young, in a state of Drunkenness,
were disputing regarding a woman, no person not even
the woman being present, when one struck a dagger into
the thigh of the other, who expired two days after ...
some men of the Fehlee<a name="FNanchor_BX_76" id="FNanchor_BX_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_BX_76" class="fnanchor">[BX]</a> Tribe were sitting together one
night, talking over occurrences of former years, when
... an excellent horseman, was shot in the side with a
pistol, and immediately yielded his life.<a name="Nanchor_VI11"
id="Nanchor_VI11"></a><a href="#Note_VI11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Qub&aacute;d <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, a nephew of the &Iacute;l<span class="u">kh</span>&aacute;n&iacute; (the supreme head
of the Qa<span class="u">sh</span>q&aacute;'&iacute; tribe), who governed F&iacute;r&uacute;z&aacute;b&aacute;d in the heart
of the Qa<span class="u">sh</span>q&aacute;'&iacute; terrain, had, for a financial consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
put armed men at the disposal of some headmen of the
village of Maymand to settle a vendetta&mdash;and so the story
trails on.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1844 &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n was given
the governorship of F&aacute;rs, but as late as December 21st
and December 24th M&iacute;rz&aacute; Ri&#7693;&aacute; was still pouring out tales
of woe to Captain Hennell in B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr. Matters had reached
such a pitch, he said, that people were stripped naked in
plain daylight in public thoroughfares, and if anyone
offered resistance he was repeatedly stabbed; at night so
many matchlocks were fired at random that no sleep was
possible, and in any case people had to keep awake to guard
their homes. The unpleasant yet humorous experience of a
physician clearly shows the breakdown of law in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z at
that time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... some of the Alwat<a name="FNanchor_BY_77" id="FNanchor_BY_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_BY_77" class="fnanchor">[BY]</a> brought a horse to the door of
a Physician's Dispensary, whose equipment and clothes
were of the best, saying, 'We have an invalid who is very
ill, take the trouble to come to him and we will attend
you.' The Poor Physician starts for the sickman's [sic]
dwelling, and they take him through two or three streets
when they desire him to be so good as to dismount from
the horse; he does so, and they strip him from head to foot
and go their way.<a name="Nanchor_VI12" id="Nanchor_VI12"></a><a
href="#Note_VI12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>During that period of anarchy the B&aacute;b was on pilgrimage
and absent from <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n arrived at his post
in the early part of 1845, when the B&aacute;b was about halfway
back to His native land. The new Governor set about with
all dispatch to give the <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z&iacute;s a lesson which he was certain
they would take to heart. There were mutilations and executions
until order was finally restored. But in little more than
three years when Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h died, <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z&iacute;s, headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
once again by the astute &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Qav&aacute;mu'l-Mulk and the headstrong
Mu&#7717;ammad-Qul&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n (the &Iacute;lbag&iacute;<a name="FNanchor_BZ_78" id="FNanchor_BZ_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_BZ_78" class="fnanchor">[BZ]</a> of the Qa<span class="u">sh</span>q&aacute;'&iacute;s),
rebelled and forced the dismissal of &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n was the first official in Persia to raise his
hand against the B&aacute;b and His people. Having meted out cruel
punishments to Qudd&uacute;s and the other two B&aacute;b&iacute;s, and having
acquainted himself with the identity of the B&aacute;b and ascertained
that He had arrived at B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr, &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n commissioned
a body of horsemen to go to that port, arrest the
B&aacute;b and bring Him to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. In the meantime the B&aacute;b had
completed His arrangements to return to the city of His
birth.</p>

<p>At D&aacute;lak&iacute;, some forty miles to the north-east of B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr,
where the coastal plain ends and the plateau begins to rise,
&#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n's horsemen encountered the B&aacute;b. He was the
first to notice them and sent His Ethiopian servant to call
them to Him. They were reluctant to approach Him, but
A&#7779;l&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, a man senior in their ranks, accepted the
invitation. However, to the B&aacute;b's query regarding the purpose
of their mission they evasively replied that the Governor
had sent them to make some investigation in that
neighbourhood. But the B&aacute;b said to them:</p>

<blockquote><p>The governor has sent you to arrest Me. Here am I; do
with Me as you please. By coming out to meet you, I
have curtailed the length of your march, and have made
it easier for you to find Me.<a name="Nanchor_VI13" id="Nanchor_VI13"></a><a
href="#Note_VI13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER 7<br />
BELIEF AND DENIAL</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Know then thyself, presume not God to scan;<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>The B&aacute;b was now a captive, and a captive, apart from a few
short months, He remained to the very end. The escort,
which should have arrested Him and taken Him in chains to
the city of His birth, was subdued and reverent. He rode to
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z almost in triumph. It would have been feasible to
avoid &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n's horsemen and seek a safe retreat; but
He Himself chose to reveal Himself to His would-be captors.
Even more, He said to their spokesman who was enthralled
by His unrivalled act, and was entreating Him to take the
road to safety, to go to Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had and find refuge in the shrine
of the eighth Im&aacute;m:</p>

<blockquote><p>May the Lord your God requite you for your magnanimity
and noble intention. No one knows the mystery
of My Cause; no one can fathom its secrets. Never will
I turn My face away from the decree of God. He alone
is My sure Stronghold, My Stay and My Refuge. Until My
last hour is at hand, none dare assail Me, none can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>frustrate the plan of the Almighty. And when My hour
is come, how great will be My joy to quaff the cup of
martyrdom in His name! Here am I; deliver Me into the
hands of your master. Be not afraid, for no one will
blame you.<a name="Nanchor_VII1" id="Nanchor_VII1"></a><a
href="#Note_VII1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When the identity of the B&aacute;b became known some members
of His family felt concern, even alarm, lest great harm
might come to Him, and they themselves suffer in the process.
Only one uncle, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Ali, His former
guardian, who had reared Him and established Him in the
world of commerce, believed in His Divine Mission. So did
His wife. But the rest, even His mother, were sceptical and
one or two were definitely antagonistic.</p>

<p>When Mu&#7717;ammad, the Arabian Prophet, refused to bend
to the dictates of His tribe, the elders of Quray<span class="u">sh</span> went to His
aged uncle, Ab&uacute;-&#7788;&aacute;lib, in whose home He had grown to
manhood, and demanded that Mu&#7717;ammad be put under
restraint. Ab&uacute;-&#7788;&aacute;lib urged his Nephew to be moderate, but
finding Mu&#7717;ammad determined to pursue His course,
assured Him that his protection would never waver. The
elders of Quray<span class="u">sh</span> then decided on a stratagem to erode the
support that Mu&#7717;ammad received from His clan&mdash;the
Ban&uacute;-H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>im. A boycott was ordered, but the descendants
of H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>im, with the solitary exception of Ab&uacute;-Lahab,<a name="FNanchor_CA_79" id="FNanchor_CA_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_CA_79" class="fnanchor">[CA]</a> one
of the several uncles of the Prophet, moved to a section at
the edge of the town and lived for three years in a state of
siege, in defence of Mu&#7717;ammad, although most of them still
worshipped their old idols.</p>

<p>The relatives of the B&aacute;b did as Mu&#7717;ammad's relatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
before them. Whatever doubts they may have had, they
stood by Him.</p>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad, another maternal uncle
of the B&aacute;b, did not come to believe in his Nephew as the
Q&aacute;'im of the House of Mu&#7717;ammad until more than a decade
later, when he presented his questions and his doubts to
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h and received in answer the <i>Kit&aacute;b-i-&Iacute;q&aacute;n</i>&mdash;<i>The
Book of Certitude</i>. Yet, such were the magnetic powers of the
B&aacute;b that when He reached B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr and was welcomed by
this uncle, the latter wrote in these terms to his family in
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z:</p>

<blockquote><p>It has gladdened our hearts that His Honour the &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
[the B&aacute;b] has arrived safely and is in good health. I am at
His service and honoured to be in His company. It is
deemed advisable that He should stay here for a while.
God willing, He will, before long, honour those parts
with His presence, be assured.... His blessed Person is
our glory. Be certain of His Cause and do not let people's
idle talk cause doubts to creep into your hearts. And have
no fear whatsoever. The Lord of the world is His Protector
and gives Him victory....</p></blockquote>

<p>At the end of his letter &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad sent
a message, on behalf of his wife, to the mother of the wife
of the B&aacute;b: 'You have a son-in-law who is peerless in the
world. All the peoples of the world ought to obey Him.'<a name="Nanchor_VII3"
id="Nanchor_VII3"></a><a href="#Note_VII3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>And in a letter written shortly after, to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-`Ali, one of his sons, the same &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad quoted the B&aacute;b as saying: My proof is
My Book&mdash;let him who can, produce the like of these
verses.</p>

<p>Similarly, Mu&#7717;ammad had said in the Qur'&aacute;n:<a name="Nanchor_VII4"
id="Nanchor_VII4"></a><a href="#Note_VII4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Say: 'Bring a Book from God that gives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">better guidance than these, and follow it,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">if you speak truly.'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then if they do not answer thee, know that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">they are only following their caprices;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">and who is further astray than he who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">follows his caprice without guidance from<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God? Surely God guides not the people<br /></span>
<span class="i4">of the evildoers.<br /></span>
<span class="i21">&mdash;xxviii, 49-50.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those are the signs of God that We recite to thee in truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">in what manner of discourse then, after God and His signs,<br /></span>
<span class="i18">will they believe?<br /></span>
<span class="i35">&mdash;xlv, 5.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The B&aacute;b's entry into <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z was truly majestic. It bore
no resemblance to the condition envisaged by the Governor.
He had ordered the B&aacute;b to be brought to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z in chains.
Instead, there was the B&aacute;b riding, calm and serene, at the
head of the horsemen. They went straight to the citadel
where the Governor resided. &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n received the B&aacute;b
with overbearing insolence: 'Do you realise what a great
mischief you have kindled? Are you aware what a disgrace
you have become to the holy Faith of Isl&aacute;m and to the august
person of our sovereign? Are you not the man who claims
to be the author of a new revelation which annuls the sacred
precepts of the Qur'&aacute;n?'<a name="Nanchor_VII5" id="Nanchor_VII5"></a><a
href="#Note_VII5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The B&aacute;b spoke in reply these
words from the Qur'&aacute;n:<a name="Nanchor_VII6" id="Nanchor_VII6"></a><a
href="#Note_VII6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O believers, if an ungodly man<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>&#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n was beside himself with rage, and ordered
an attendant to strike the B&aacute;b's face. His turban fell off but
was replaced gently by <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-Tur&aacute;b, the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih,
who treated the B&aacute;b with respect and consideration.
On the other hand, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;usayn-i-`Arab, the Tyrant, who
was also present, following the example set by the arrogant
Governor of F&aacute;rs, assailed the B&aacute;b vehemently both with
hand and tongue. In the meantime news had reached the
mother of the B&aacute;b of this shameless behaviour towards
her Son. Moved by her pleadings, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;
hurried to the citadel to demand the release of his Nephew.
&#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n agreed to let the B&aacute;b go to His home, if His
uncle would promise that apart from the members of His
family no one else would be allowed to meet Him. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Ali protested that he himself was a well-known
merchant of the city, with many connections and a
host of friends and acquaintances, all of whom would wish
to visit his Nephew, who had just returned from pilgrimage
to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n,
realizing that an immediate ban was not possible, set a time
limit of three days, after which the B&aacute;b should be kept
incommunicado.</p>

<p>The months during which the B&aacute;b lived under surveillance
in His native town saw the birth of the B&aacute;b&iacute; community.
Hitherto His identity had remained unrevealed, and only
individuals, here and there and unrelated to one another,
were B&aacute;b&iacute;s. Apart from the first few months of His Ministry,
when the body of the Letters of the Living was gradually
forming, the B&aacute;b had not had a group of disciples around
Him. Even then, because of the condition which the B&aacute;b
had laid down for the attainment of those who were to be
the first believers,<a name="FNanchor_CC_81" id="FNanchor_CC_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_CC_81" class="fnanchor">[CC]</a> cohesion as one firmly-knit body was not
feasible. And as soon as the requisite number was enrolled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the B&aacute;b sent them out into the world to spread the glad
tidings of the New Day. But, once again in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, despite
the oppressive measures of &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, an appreciable
number of B&aacute;b&iacute;s came into the presence of the B&aacute;b, consorted
with Him and received instruction and Tablets from
Him. Viewed in this light, this <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z episode would seem the
most fecund period in the short Ministry of the B&aacute;b.</p>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d-i-Karbil&aacute;'&iacute;, who, as we have seen, had
known the B&aacute;b from His childhood, now hurried to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z;
and soon after came a man destined to achieve high fame in
the ranks of the 'Dawn-Breakers'. He was Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;
of D&aacute;r&aacute;b, the son of the same greatly-revered Siyyid Ja`fari-Ka<span class="u">sh</span>f&iacute;,
whom we noted before as a fellow-pilgrim of the
B&aacute;b. Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; was a divine of great erudition, and he
thought that he could easily overcome the B&aacute;b in argument.
As he lived in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, close to royal circles, Mu&#7717;ammad
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h asked Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; to go to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z and investigate
the claim of the B&aacute;b. In <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z he was the guest of the
Governor. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d-i-Karbil&aacute;'&iacute; arranged a meeting
between the B&aacute;b and Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; in the house of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Ali. At that first encounter Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;,
proud of his vast knowledge, brought out one abstruse
point after another from the Qur'&aacute;n, from Traditions, from
learned works. To all of them the B&aacute;b listened calmly, and
gave answers concise and convincing. Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; was
subdued, but still he searched for a test which would relieve
him from the necessity of giving his allegiance to the B&aacute;b.
He told &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d-i-Karbil&aacute;'&iacute; that if only the B&aacute;b
would show forth a miracle, his lingering doubts would
vanish, to which &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Jav&aacute;d replied that to demand
the performance of a miracle, when faced with the brilliance
of the Sun of Truth, was tantamount to seeking light from a
flickering candle. Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; has himself related:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I resolved that in my third interview with the B&aacute;b I
would in my inmost heart request Him to reveal for me a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>commentary on the S&uacute;rih of Kaw<span class="u">th</span>ar.<a name="FNanchor_CD_82" id="FNanchor_CD_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_CD_82" class="fnanchor">[CD]</a> I determined not
to breathe that request in His presence. Should He,
unasked by me, reveal this commentary in a manner that
would immediately distinguish it in my eyes from the
prevailing standards current among the commentators
on the Qur'&aacute;n, I then would be convinced of the Divine
character of His Mission, and would readily embrace His
Cause. If not, I would refuse to acknowledge Him. As
soon as I was ushered into His presence, a sense of fear,
for which I could not account, suddenly seized me. My
limbs quivered as I beheld His face. I, who on repeated
occasions had been introduced into the presence of the
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h and had never discovered the slightest trace of
timidity in myself, was now so awed and shaken that I
could not remain standing on my feet. The B&aacute;b, beholding
my plight, arose from His seat, advanced towards me, and,
taking hold of my hand, seated me beside Him. 'Seek
from Me,' He said, 'whatever is your heart's desire. I will
readily reveal it to you.' I was speechless with wonder.
Like a babe that can neither understand nor speak, I felt
powerless to respond. He smiled as He gazed at me and
said: 'Were I to reveal for you the commentary on the
S&uacute;rih of Kaw<span class="u">th</span>ar, would you acknowledge that My words
are born of the Spirit of God? Would you recognise that
My utterance can in no wise be associated with sorcery or
magic?' Tears flowed from my eyes as I heard Him speak
these words. All I was able to utter was this verse of the
Qur'&aacute;n: 'O our Lord, with ourselves have we dealt
unjustly: if Thou forgive us not and have not pity on us,
we shall surely be of those who perish.'</p>

<p>It was still early in the afternoon when the B&aacute;b requested
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute; to bring His pen-case and
some paper. He then started to reveal His commentary on
the S&uacute;rih of Kaw<span class="u">th</span>ar. How am I to describe this scene of
inexpressible majesty? Verses streamed from His pen
with a rapidity that was truly astounding. The incredible
swiftness of His writing, the soft and gentle murmur of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>His voice, and the stupendous force of His style, amazed
and bewildered me. He continued in this manner until
the approach of sunset. He did not pause until the entire
commentary of the S&uacute;rih was completed. He then laid
down His pen and asked for tea. Soon after, He began to
read it aloud in my presence. My heart leaped madly as I
heard Him pour out, in accents of unutterable sweetness,
those treasures enshrined in that sublime commentary.
I was so entranced by its beauty that three times over I
was on the verge of fainting. He sought to revive my
failing strength with a few drops of rose-water which He
caused to be sprinkled on my face. This restored my vigour
and enabled me to follow His reading to the end.<a name="Nanchor_VII7"

<p>The B&aacute;b's conquest of Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; was total. That night
and the two following nights, as instructed by the B&aacute;b,
Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; remained a guest in the house of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Siyyid `Al&iacute;, until he himself and Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-Kar&iacute;m-i-Qazv&iacute;n&iacute;,
the scribe, (later known as M&iacute;rz&aacute; A&#7717;mad-i-K&aacute;tib),
completed the transcription of the B&aacute;b's commentary.
Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; has stated:</p>

<blockquote><p>We verified all the traditions in the text and found them
to be entirely accurate. Such was the state of certitude to
which I had attained that if all the powers of the earth were
to be leagued against me they would be powerless to
shake my confidence in the greatness of His Cause.<a name="Nanchor_VII8"
id="Nanchor_VII8"></a><a href="#Note_VII8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; had stayed away for such a long time from
the Governor's residence that &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n's suspicions
were aroused. To his impatient queries, Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;
replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>No one but God, who alone can change the hearts of
men, is able to captivate the heart of Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;. Whoso
can ensnare his heart is of God, and His word unquestionably
the voice of Truth.<a name="Nanchor_VII9" id="Nanchor_VII9"></a><a
href="#Note_VII9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>&#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n was nonplussed and, for the moment, could
only hold his peace; but he wrote bitterly to Mu&#7717;ammad
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h to denounce Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;. Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am states that
Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h reprimanded his Governor, replying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is strictly forbidden to any one of our subjects to utter
such words as would tend to detract from the exalted
rank of Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;y-i-D&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute;. He is of noble lineage,
a man of great learning, of perfect and consummate
virtue. He will under no circumstances incline his ear
to any cause unless he believes it to be conducive to the
advancement of the best interests of our realm and to the
well-being of the Faith of Isl&aacute;m.<a name="Nanchor_VII10"
id="Nanchor_VII10"></a><a href="#Note_VII10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nab&iacute;l has also recorded that</p>

<blockquote><p>Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h ... was reported to have addressed
these words to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;: 'We have been lately
informed that Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;y-i-D&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute; has become a
B&aacute;b&iacute;. If this be true, it behoves us to cease belittling the
cause of that siyyid.'<a href="#Note_VII10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; has stated that Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;</p>

<blockquote><p>wrote without fear or care a detailed account of his observations
to M&iacute;rz&aacute; Lu&#7789;f-`Al&iacute;, the chamberlain in order that
the latter might submit it to the notice of the late king,
while he himself journeyed to all parts of Persia, and in
every town and station summoned the people from the
pulpit-tops in such wise that other learned doctors
decided that he must be mad, accounting it a sure case
of bewitchment.<a name="Nanchor_VII11" id="Nanchor_VII11"></a><a
href="#Note_VII11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At the bidding of the B&aacute;b, Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; went first to
Bur&uacute;jird in the province of Lurist&aacute;n, where his father lived,
to give that much-revered divine the tidings of the New Day.
The B&aacute;b expressly told him to treat his father with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
gentleness. Siyyid Ja`far-i-Ka<span class="u">sh</span>f&iacute;<a name="FNanchor_CE_83" id="FNanchor_CE_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_CE_83" class="fnanchor">[CE]</a> did not wholly turn away
from the Faith which his illustrious son was fervently professing
and advocating, but showed no desire to identify
himself with it. Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;, as commanded by the B&aacute;b,
did not burden his father more and went his own way which
he had gladly chosen&mdash;the way that was to lead him to
martyrdom. Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute; is known as Va&#7717;&iacute;d&mdash;the Unique
One&mdash;a designation given to him by the B&aacute;b.<a name="FNanchor_CF_84" id="FNanchor_CF_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_CF_84" class="fnanchor">[CF]</a></p>

<p>The divines of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z were insistent that the B&aacute;b should
attend a Friday gathering in one of the mosques and clarify
his position. What they really demanded was the complete
renunciation of any claim. This attendance in a mosque on
a Friday did take place, but the date of it is not known.</p>

<p>Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am thus describes the summoning of the B&aacute;b
to the Mosque of Vak&iacute;l:<a name="Nanchor_VII12" id="Nanchor_VII12"></a><a
href="#Note_VII12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The B&aacute;b, accompanied by &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;,
arrived at the Masjid at a time when the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih
had just ascended the pulpit and was preparing to deliver
his sermon. As soon as his eyes fell upon the B&aacute;b, he
publicly welcomed Him, requested Him to ascend the
pulpit, and called upon Him to address the congregation.
The B&aacute;b, responding to his invitation, advanced towards
him and, standing on the first step of the staircase, prepared
to address the people. 'Come up higher,' interjected
the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih. Complying with his wish, the
B&aacute;b ascended two more steps. As He was standing, His
head hid the breast of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-Tur&aacute;b, who was occupying
the pulpit-top. He began by prefacing His public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>declaration with an introductory discourse. No sooner
had He uttered the opening words of 'Praise be to God,
who hath in truth created the heavens and the earth,'
than a certain siyyid known as Siyyid-i-<span class="u">Sh</span>i<span class="u">sh</span>-Par&iacute;, whose
function was to carry the mace before the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih,
insolently shouted: 'Enough of this idle chatter! Declare,
now and immediately, the thing you intend to say.'
The Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih greatly resented the rudeness of the
siyyid's remark. 'Hold your peace,' he rebuked him, 'and
be ashamed of your impertinence.' He then, turning to
the B&aacute;b, asked Him to be brief, as this, he said, would
allay the excitement of the people. The B&aacute;b, as He faced
the congregation, declared: 'The condemnation of God
be upon him who regards me either as a representative
of the Im&aacute;m or the gate thereof. The condemnation of
God be also upon whosoever imputes to me the charge
of having denied the unity of God, of having repudiated
the prophethood of Mu&#7717;ammad, the Seal of the Prophets,
of having rejected the truth of any of the messengers of
old, or of having refused to recognise the guardianship
of `Al&iacute;, the Commander of the Faithful, or of any of the
im&aacute;ms who have succeeded him.' He then ascended to the
top of the staircase, embraced the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih, and,
descending to the floor of the Masjid, joined the congregation
for the observance of the Friday prayer. The
Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih intervened and requested Him to retire.
'Your family,' he said, 'is anxiously awaiting your return.
All are apprehensive lest any harm befall you. Repair
to your house and there offer your prayer; of greater
merit shall this deed be in the sight of God.' &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Siyyid `Al&iacute; also was, at the request of the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih,
asked to accompany his nephew to his home. This
precautionary measure which <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-Tur&aacute;b thought
it wise to observe was actuated by the fear lest, after the
dispersion of the congregation, a few of the evil-minded
among the crowd might still attempt to injure the person
of the B&aacute;b or endanger His life. But for the sagacity, the
sympathy, and the careful attention which the Im&aacute;m-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>Jum`ih
so strikingly displayed on a number of such
occasions, the infuriated mob would doubtless have been
led to gratify its savage desire, and would have committed
the most abominable of excesses. He seemed to
have been the instrument of the invisible Hand appointed
to protect both the person and the Mission of that
Youth.<a name="Nanchor_VII13" id="Nanchor_VII13"></a><a
href="#Note_VII13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Regarding that gathering in the Mosque of Vak&iacute;l, `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;
has written:</p>

<blockquote><p>One day they summoned him to the mosque urging
and constraining him to recant, but he discoursed from
the pulpit in such wise as to silence and subdue those
present and to stablish and strengthen his followers. It
was then supposed that he claimed to be the medium of
grace from His Highness the Lord of the Age<a name="FNanchor_CG_85" id="FNanchor_CG_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_CG_85" class="fnanchor">[CG]</a> (upon him
be peace); but afterwards it became known and evident
that his meaning was the Gate-hood [<i>B&aacute;biyyat</i>] of another
city and the mediumship of the graces of another person
whose qualities and attributes were contained in his
books and treatises.<a name="Nanchor_VII14" id="Nanchor_VII14"></a><a
href="#Note_VII14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;ab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h-i-Afn&aacute;n has this record in his
chronicle:</p>

<p>'The late &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-S&aacute;diq-i-Mu`allim
[Teacher], who was a man of good repute, was relating the
story of that day for the late `Andal&iacute;b.<a name="Nanchor_VII15" id="Nanchor_VII15"></a><a
href="#Note_VII15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> My brother, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Buzurg, and I were present. This is the summary of
what he said: "I was about twenty-five years old and able to
judge an issue. It was noised abroad that the Governor, by
the request of the divines, had ordered that the people of
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, of all classes, should gather in the Masjid-i-Vak&iacute;l,
as the Siyyid-i-B&aacute;b was going to renounce His claim. I too
went to the mosque to find a place near [the pulpit] so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>I might hear well all that He had to say. From the morning
onwards, people, group by group, thronged the mosque.
Three hours before sunset there was such a press of people
in the mosque that the cloisters and the courtyard and the
roofs, even the minarets, were fully crowded. The Governor,
the divines, the merchants and the notables were sitting
in the cloisters, near the stone pulpit. (This is a pulpit
carved out of one piece of marble. It has fourteen steps.)
I was also sitting near it. Voices were heard in the courtyard,
saying: 'He is coming.' He came through the gate, accompanied
by ten footmen and `Abdu'l-&#7716;am&iacute;d <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-D&aacute;r&uacute;<span class="u">gh</span>ih
[chief of police], and approached the pulpit. He had His
turban on and an `ab&aacute; on His shoulders. He displayed such
power and dignity and His bearing was so sublime that I
cannot describe it adequately. That vast gathering seemed
as naught to Him. He paid no heed to that assemblage of
the people. He addressed &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n and the divines:
'What is your intention in asking Me to come here?' They
answered: 'The intention is that you should ascend this
pulpit and repudiate your false claim so that this commotion
and unrest will subside.' He said nothing and went up to the
third step of the pulpit. <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;usayn, the Tyrant, said
with utmost vehemence: 'Go to the top of the pulpit so
that all may see and hear you.' The B&aacute;b ascended the pulpit
and sat down at the top. All of a sudden, silence fell upon
that assemblage. It seemed as if there was not a soul in the
mosque. The whole concourse of people strained their ears.
He began to recite at the start a homily in Arabic on Divine
Unity. It was delivered with utmost eloquence, with
majesty and power. It lasted about half an hour, and the
concourse of people, high and low, learned and illiterate
alike, listened attentively and were fascinated. The people's
silence infuriated <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;usayn, who turned to the Governor
and said: 'Did you bring this Siyyid here, into the presence
of all these people, to prove His Cause, or did you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>bring Him to recant and renounce His false claim? He will
soon with these words win over all these people to His side.
Tell Him to say what He has to say. What are all these idle
tales?' &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the &#7778;&aacute;&#7717;ib-I<span class="u">kh</span>tiy&aacute;r, told the B&aacute;b:
'O Siyyid! say what you have been told to say. What is this
idle chatter?' The B&aacute;b was silent for a moment and then He
addressed the crowd: 'O people! Know this well that I
speak what My Grandfather, the Messenger of God, spoke
twelve hundred and sixty years ago, and I do not speak
what My Grandfather did not. "What Mu&#7717;ammad made
lawful remains lawful unto the Day of Resurrection and what
He forbade remains forbidden unto the Day of Resurrection",<a name="FNanchor_CH_86" id="FNanchor_CH_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_CH_86" class="fnanchor">[CH]</a>
and according to the Tradition that has come down
from the Im&aacute;ms, "Whenever the Q&aacute;'im arises that will be
the Day of Resurrection".' The B&aacute;b, having spoken those
words, descended from the pulpit. Some of the people,
who had been inimical and hostile, that day foreswore their
antagonism. But when the B&aacute;b came face to face with
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;usayn, that enemy raised his walking-stick to
strike Him. The late M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-&#7716;asan <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the
Mu<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;ru'l-Mulk,<a name="FNanchor_CI_87" id="FNanchor_CI_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_CI_87" class="fnanchor">[CI]</a> who was then a young man, brought
forward his shoulder to ward off the attack, and it was his
shoulder that was hit."</p>

<p>'That &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; [&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-&#7778;&aacute;diq], who was not
a believer but a well-wisher, related this story to the late
`Andal&iacute;b. His meaning was that the B&aacute;b, on that occasion,
affirmed His Cause and completed His proof before the
concourse of people.'</p>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Hab&iacute;bu'll&aacute;h goes on to say: 'Then the divines
came together and passed a sentence of death on the B&aacute;b.
They wrote out their verdict and affixed their seals to it. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>instigator of this move and the source of all mischief was
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;usayn, the Tyrant, who held the title of N&aacute;&#7827;im'u<span class="u">sh</span>-<span class="u">Sh</span>ar&iacute;y`ih.
Their numbers included <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-H&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>im,
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Asadu'll&aacute;h, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Mihd&iacute;y-i-Kuj&uacute;r&iacute; and Mull&aacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;y-i-Ma&#7717;all&aacute;t&iacute;. Next they took what they
had written and sealed to the late <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-Tur&aacute;b, the
Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih, because he had refused to heed their pleas
and had declined to attend their meeting. Now they presented
their paper to the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih and asked him to put
his seal on it that "we may finish off this Siyyid". <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>
Ab&uacute;-Tur&aacute;b, on perusing the verdict, became very angry,
threw that piece of paper on the ground and said, "Have you
gone out of your minds? I will never put my seal on this
paper, because I have no doubts about the lineage, integrity,
piety, nobility and honesty of this Siyyid. I see that this young
Man is possessed of all the virtues of Isl&aacute;m and humanity
and of all the faculties of intellect. There can be only two
sides to this question: He either speaks the truth, or He is,
as you allege, a liar. If He be truthful I cannot endorse
such a verdict on a man of truth, and if He be a liar, as you
aver, tell me which one of us present here is so strictly
truthful as to sit in judgment upon this Siyyid. Away with
you and your false imaginings, away, away!" No matter
how hard they tried and how much they insisted, the late
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-Tur&aacute;b did not grant them their wish; and
because he declined to put his seal on their paper, their plan
was brought to naught and they did not succeed in achieving
their objective.'</p>

<p>According to Nicolas, Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h asked Siyyid
Ya&#7717;y&aacute;y-i-D&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute; to go to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z and investigate the Cause
of the B&aacute;b, when the account of the gathering in the Mosque
of Vak&iacute;l was presented to him.<a name="Nanchor_VII16"
id="Nanchor_VII16"></a><a href="#Note_VII16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; tells us that when the news of the journeys
of Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;y-i-D&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute; and the anger provoked by them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>reached Zanj&aacute;n, Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad `Al&iacute; the divine, who
was a man of mark possessed of penetrating speech, sent
one of those on whom he could rely to Sh&iacute;r&aacute;z to investigate
this matter. This person, having acquainted himself
with the details of these occurrences in such wise as was
necessary and proper, returned with some [of the B&aacute;b's]
writings. When the divine heard how matters were and
had made himself acquainted with the writings, notwithstanding
that he was a man expert in knowledge and
noted for profound research, he went mad and became
crazed as was predestined: he gathered up his books in the
lecture-room saying, 'The season of spring and wine has
arrived,' and uttered this sentence:-'<i>Search for knowledge
after reaching the known is culpable.</i>' Then from the summit
of the pulpit he summoned and directed all his disciples
[to embrace the doctrine], and wrote to the B&aacute;b his own
declaration and confession....</p>

<p>Although the doctors of Zanj&aacute;n arose with heart and
soul to exhort and admonish the people they could effect
nothing. Finally they were compelled to go to Teher&aacute;n
and made their complaint before the late king Mu&#7717;ammad
Sh&aacute;h, requesting that Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad `Al&iacute; be
summoned to Teher&aacute;n.</p>

<p>Now when he came to Teher&aacute;n they brought him before
a conclave of the doctors ... after many controversies
and disputations nought was effected with him in that
assembly. The late king therefore bestowed on him a staff
and fifty <i>t&uacute;m&aacute;ns</i> for his expenses, and gave him permission
to return.<a name="Nanchor_VII17" id="Nanchor_VII17"></a><a
href="#Note_VII17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The confidant whom Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute; of Zanj&aacute;n,
better known as &#7716;ujjat (the Proof),<a name="FNanchor_CJ_88" id="FNanchor_CJ_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_CJ_88" class="fnanchor">[CJ]</a> sent to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z to investigate
the Cause of the B&aacute;b was named Mull&aacute; Iskandar. Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am
describes his return:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>He arrived at a time when all the leading `ulam&aacute;s of the
city had assembled in the presence of &#7716;ujjat. As soon as
he appeared, &#7716;ujjat enquired whether he believed in, or
rejected, the new Revelation. Mull&aacute; Iskandar submitted
the writings of the B&aacute;b ... and asserted that whatever
should be the verdict of his master, the same would he
deem it his obligation to follow. 'What!' angrily exclaimed
&#7716;ujjat. 'But for the presence of this distinguished company,
I would have chastised you severely. How dare you
consider matters of belief to be dependent upon the
approbation or rejection of others?' Receiving from the
hand of his messenger the copy of the Qayy&uacute;mu'l-Asm&aacute;',
he, as soon as he had perused a page of that book, fell
prostrate upon the ground and exclaimed: 'I bear witness
that these words which I have read proceed from the
same Source as that of the Qur'&aacute;n. Whoso has recognised
the truth of that sacred Book must needs testify to the
Divine origin of these words, and must needs submit to
the precepts inculcated by their Author. I take you,
members of this assembly, as my witnesses: I pledge such
allegiance to the Author of this Revelation that should He
ever pronounce the night to be the day, and declare the
sun to be a shadow, I would unreservedly submit to His
judgment, and would regard His verdict as the voice of
Truth.'<a name="Nanchor_VII18" id="Nanchor_VII18"></a><a
href="#Note_VII18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute; of Zanj&aacute;n, who, like Siyyid
Ya&#7717;y&aacute; of D&aacute;r&aacute;b, was destined to become a brilliant star in
the B&aacute;b&iacute; firmament, was a practitioner of the A<span class="u">kh</span>b&aacute;r&iacute;
school,<a name="Nanchor_VII19" id="Nanchor_VII19"></a><a href="#Note_VII19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and that had placed him oftentimes at odds with
other divines of his rank and station. Beyond that variance
Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute; was always very forceful and emphatic
in the expression of his views. That forthrightness,
sustained by his vast knowledge and lucid speech, had led
to serious disputations with his peers. Time and again the
mediation of no less a person than the monarch himself had
saved the situation from deterioration into violence. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
once before been summoned to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, where, in the presence
of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, he had worsted his opponents.
As the common parlance has it, he was not a man to mince
his words.</p>

<p>There were a number of B&aacute;b&iacute;s in Karbil&aacute; eagerly awaiting
the arrival of the B&aacute;b. The news that the B&aacute;b had changed
His route shook the faith of a few of them. As instructed by
the B&aacute;b Himself, these B&aacute;b&iacute;s left Karbil&aacute; for I&#7779;fah&aacute;n. At
Kang&aacute;var, situated between Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h and Hamad&aacute;n,
they encountered Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, the B&aacute;bu'l-B&aacute;b, and his
brother and nephew, whose destination was Karbil&aacute;. But,
hearing what had happened, Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn decided to
accompany them to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n. There he received the news
from <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z that the B&aacute;b was under constraint. He determined
to continue on to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, accompanied, as before, by
his brother and nephew. He took off his turban and clerical
robes and put on the accoutrements of a horseman of the
Hiz&aacute;rih tribe in <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n. Thus he entered the gate of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z
and reached the house of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;. Some days
later M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;y-i-Nahr&iacute; with his brother
M&iacute;rz&aacute; H&aacute;d&iacute;, and Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-Kar&iacute;m-i-Qazv&iacute;n&iacute; arrived at
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, and with them were Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-`Al&iacute;y-i-Hir&aacute;t&iacute;
and Mull&aacute; Jav&aacute;d-i-Bara<span class="u">gh</span>&aacute;n&iacute;, who were fickle and deeply
jealous of Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn. In spite of Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn's disguise,
the enemies of the B&aacute;b soon recognized him, and the
cry went up denouncing his presence in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. Then the
B&aacute;b directed Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn to Yazd, whence he was to
proceed to <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n. Others He also told to leave; only
Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-Kar&iacute;m remained to be His scribe. Those who
had professed the Faith of the B&aacute;b to gain their own ends,
such as Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-`Al&iacute;y-i-Hir&aacute;t&iacute;, went to Kirm&aacute;n
and attached themselves to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Kar&iacute;m <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-Kirm&aacute;n&iacute;,
who, by this date, had assumed the leadership
of the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute; community.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>A number of other B&aacute;b&iacute;s, as previously mentioned, also
repaired to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z and attained the presence of the B&aacute;b.
One of them was Mull&aacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `Al&iacute; of <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n, whom the
B&aacute;b designated as `A&#7827;&iacute;m<a name="FNanchor_CK_89" id="FNanchor_CK_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_CK_89" class="fnanchor">[CK]</a> (Great). He was still in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z
when Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;y-i-D&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute; came to make his investigation.
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute; was another. Moreover, <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z
itself had by this time a group of native B&aacute;b&iacute;s. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Abu'l-&#7716;asan,
the B&aacute;b's fellow-pilgrim, was one; another was a
nephew of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Ab&uacute;-Tur&aacute;b, the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih, a youth
named <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>-`Al&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;; yet another, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Bis&aacute;t,
a close friend of the same Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih; and to name
a few more: M&iacute;rz&aacute;-&Aacute;q&aacute;y-i-Rik&aacute;b-S&aacute;z (Stirrup-maker),
destined to fall a martyr, one of the very few who quaffed
the cup of martyrdom in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z itself; Lu&#7789;f-`Al&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;, a
descendant of the Af<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;r kings (1736-95), whom we shall
meet in a subsequent chapter; &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Kar&iacute;m, a
merchant, who was eventually compelled by continued persecution
to abandon his native city; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Ra&#7717;&iacute;m, a baker,
who became an ardent teacher of the Faith; M&iacute;rz&aacute; `Abdu'l-Kar&iacute;m,
who had the office of key-holder to the shrine known
as <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h-<span class="u">Ch</span>ir&aacute;<span class="u">gh</span><a name="FNanchor_CL_90" id="FNanchor_CL_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_CL_90" class="fnanchor">[CL]</a> (King of the Lamp) where M&iacute;r A&#7717;mad, a
brother of the eighth Im&aacute;m, is buried; Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had&iacute; Abu'l-Q&aacute;sim-i-Labb&aacute;f
(Quilt-maker), whose son &#7716;i<span class="u">sh</span>mat achieved
fame as a poet; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mihd&iacute;, a poet of note, whose soubriquet
was &#7778;&aacute;bir (Patient), and his son, M&iacute;rz&aacute; `Al&iacute;-Akbar.
Most of these native B&aacute;b&iacute;s of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z embraced the Faith
after hearing the B&aacute;b from the pulpit of the Mosque of Vak&iacute;l.</p>

<p>By the summer of 1846, the B&aacute;b had cleared the way for
another chapter in the progress of His Ministry. He bequeathed
all His property jointly to His mother and to His
wife, who was to inherit subsequently the whole estate.<a name="FNanchor_CM_91" id="FNanchor_CM_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_CM_91" class="fnanchor">[CM]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>Then He took up His residence in the house of His uncle,
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;. That was the house where He was
born and where He had spent much of His childhood. At
the time of this move, He told those of His followers who
had come to make their home in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z to go to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n.
Included in that group were Siyyid &#7716;usayn-i-Yazd&iacute;, one
of the Letters of the Living, who later became the amanuensis
of the B&aacute;b, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute; and Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-Kar&iacute;m-i-Qazv&iacute;n&iacute;,
the scribe.</p>

<p>One evening it was reported to the Governor that a large
number of B&aacute;b&iacute;s had gathered in the house of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Siyyid `Al&iacute;. &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n ordered `Abdu'l-&#7716;am&iacute;d <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n,
the D&aacute;r&uacute;<span class="u">gh</span>ih (chief constable) of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, to rush the house
of the uncle of the B&aacute;b, surprise its occupants and arrest
everyone he found there. According to Nicolas, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
&Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; had instructed the Governor to put the B&aacute;b to death
in secret. It was apparently &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n's intention to
carry out the orders of the Grand Vizier that night. However,
that very night a severe cholera epidemic swept the city,<a name="FNanchor_CN_92" id="FNanchor_CN_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_CN_92" class="fnanchor">[CN]</a>
and &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n fled precipitately. The chief constable and
his men entered &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;'s house by way of the
roof-top, but found no one with the B&aacute;b, except His uncle
and one disciple, Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Zanj&aacute;n&iacute;. With the Governor
gone, the chief constable decided to take the B&aacute;b to his
own house. Reaching his home, `Abdu'l-&#7716;am&iacute;d <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
found, to his horror and distress, that within the few hours
of his absence his sons had been struck by cholera. He
pleaded with the B&aacute;b for their recovery. It was now the hour
of dawn and the B&aacute;b was preparing to say His morning
prayer. He gave `Abdu'l-Ham&iacute;d <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n some of the water
with which He was making His ablutions and told him to
take it to his sons to drink; they would recover, the B&aacute;b
assured the chief constable. They recovered indeed, and
`Abdu'l-Ham&iacute;d <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n was so overwhelmed with joy and
gratitude that he sought out the Governor and begged
&#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n to permit him to release the B&aacute;b. `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;
states in <i>A Traveller's Narrative</i> that &#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n consented
on condition that the B&aacute;b agreed to depart from <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z.<a
name="Nanchor_VII20" id="Nanchor_VII20"></a><a href="#Note_VII20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p class="center">NOTE</p>

<p>When this book had reached the stage of paginated proofs,
the writer received a number of very important documents,
one of which is a historical find of prime importance. It is
a letter from the B&aacute;b to His uncle, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;,
written at Kun&aacute;r-Ta<span class="u">kh</span>tih, a stage further from D&aacute;lak&iacute;, on
the B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr-<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z road. It was at D&aacute;lak&iacute; that He encountered
the horsemen sent to arrest Him. He mentions the esteem
shown to Him by those horsemen. But the importance of
this letter lies in the fact that it is precisely dated: 24th of the
2nd Jam&aacute;d&iacute; 1261, which corresponds to June 30th 1845. The
date of the B&aacute;b's departure from B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr had nowhere been
recorded and had remained unknown. It must have taken
Him another week, at least, to reach <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. Departing for
I&#7779;fah&aacute;n in the last days of September 1846, His sojurn in His
native city was, thus, less than fifteen months.</p>

<p>Autumn was setting in when the B&aacute;b left the house of
`Abdu'l-&#7716;am&iacute;d <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, turned His back on <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z and took
the road to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n. He was attended by Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Zanj&aacute;n&iacute;.<a name="Nanchor_VIII1"
id="Nanchor_VIII1"></a><a href="#Note_VIII1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
No opportunity had there been for Him to see
His mother and His wife, and they never met again. But He
said farewell to His uncle, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;.</p>

<p>His family was in great distress, and the confounded
and frustrated Governor turned upon them to give vent to
his fury. First he seized and chastised the venerable &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;, then had his men break into the house of
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Q&aacute;sim, the brother-in-law of the B&aacute;b,
who was dangerously ill in bed. He was dragged out, carried
to the Governor's residence, threatened, reviled and fined.
Porters took him back to his house, slinging him over their
shoulders since he was unable to walk. The people of
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z were warned that if a single sheet of the writings of
the B&aacute;b was found in their possession, they would be
severely punished. In their panic, scores dashed to the house
of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Q&aacute;sim with bundles of the writings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the B&aacute;b, all written in His own hand, threw them into the
open portico of the house and dashed away, lest they might
be seen with the incriminating material. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid
`Al&iacute; advised the members of that household to wash away
the ink and bury the sodden paper.<a name="FNanchor_CO_93" id="FNanchor_CO_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_CO_93" class="fnanchor">[CO]</a></p>

<p>A day or two before the house of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;
was raided, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Q&aacute;sim wrote to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad, who was still in B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr, in tones of
great dismay: opposition was mounting, even a relative
by marriage was vociferously denouncing the B&aacute;b (whom he
names as &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; `Al&iacute;-Mu&#7717;ammad throughout his
letter) and &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;. As there were certain
matters which &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute; could not manage by
himself, he desired &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad to come as
soon as possible from B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr, to do all that was needed to
settle their affairs. 'Some people may feel ashamed and keep
within bounds when they see you,' he wrote. He wanted to
be freed of their trading engagements so that he could take
his family and leave <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, to avoid any further injustices.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, towards which the B&aacute;b set His face, was and is,
<i>par excellence</i>, the city of `Abb&aacute;s the Great, the most illustrious
of the &#7778;afavid monarchs (1501-1732), who is best
known in the West because of his association with the
Sherley brothers and the East India Company, with whose
aid he drove the Portuguese out of the Persian Gulf. He is
'The Great Sophy' of Shakespeare. I&#7779;fah&aacute;n had been the
capital of the Salj&uacute;qs (Seljucids), centuries before, but it
had suffered neglect in the intervening years. <span class="u">Sh</span>ah `Abb&aacute;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
moved his capital from Qazv&iacute;n to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, and began restoring
the city which was to be styled, erelong, Ni&#7779;f-i-Jah&aacute;n&mdash;Half-the-World.
Magnificent mosques and colleges
and pavilions, and the largest public square in the world, are
prominent among that great ruler's works, and are there
today to inspire wonder and admiration. But with the decline
and eventual fall of the &#7778;afavids, I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, too, declined and
met with repeated misfortunes in the days of the Q&aacute;j&aacute;rs,
who pulled down or painted over &#7778;afavid buildings.</p>

<p>In that autumn of 1846, the Governor-General of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n
was a Georgian eunuch: Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the Mu`tamidu'd-Dawlih.
He had been, writes Layard,</p>

<blockquote><p>purchased in his childhood as a slave, had been brought
up a Musulman, and reduced to his unhappy condition.
Like many of his kind, he was employed when young in
the public service, and had by his remarkable abilities
risen to the highest posts. He had for many years enjoyed
the confidence and the favour of the Shah. Considered
the best administrator in the kingdom, he had been sent
to govern the great province of Isfahan, which included
within its limits the wild and lawless tribes of the Lurs
and Bakhtiyari, generally in rebellion, and the semi-independent
Arab population of the plains between the Luristan
Mountains and the Euphrates. He was hated and
feared for his cruelty, but it was generally admitted that
he ruled justly, that he protected the weak from oppression
by the strong, and that where he was able to enforce
his authority life and property were secure.<a name="Nanchor_VIII2"
id="Nanchor_VIII2"></a><a href="#Note_VIII2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Layard established a close friendship with Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute;
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the chieftain of the <span class="u">Ch</span>ah&aacute;r-Lang section of the
Ba<span class="u">kh</span>t&iacute;y&aacute;r&iacute;s. Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n captured this chieftain, after
lengthy manoeuvres, and sent him with his family to
&#7788;ihr&aacute;n, where he died. Chiefly for that reason Layard is
not at all complimentary in his copious writings about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n. There is no doubt that the Ba<span class="u">kh</span>t&iacute;y&aacute;r&iacute;
chieftain was in rebellion against the central government
and even intended to take himself and his territory out of its
jurisdiction. The proof is afforded by the fact that he sent
Henry Layard to the island of <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;rg, then occupied by
British forces, to sound the British authorities for support.
Hennell told Layard that although Britain was in a state
bordering on war with &Iacute;r&aacute;n, she would not countenance or
encourage insurrection or secession.</p>

<p>Disregarding Layard's prejudices, the fact remains that
historical evidence exists in plenty to prove that Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n had, in the company of his peers, his ample share of
avarice and cruelty. He had been a faithful servant of
Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, had fought battles for him to make his
throne secure, and had, in successive appointments, pacified
a vast area of the country, stretching from Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h
in the west to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n in the central regions, and to the waters
of the Persian Gulf in the south. When he served as the
Vizier of the province of F&aacute;rs, he put down an uprising,
brought some seventy to eighty prisoners with him to
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, and outside the gate of B&aacute;<span class="u">gh</span>-i-<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h had a tower
erected with their living bodies, which was held firm by
mortar.</p>

<p>The B&aacute;b, as He approached I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, wrote a letter to
Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n in which he asked for shelter. Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Zanj&aacute;n&iacute; took the letter to the Governor, who,
greatly impressed by it, sent it on to Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad,
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;nu'l-`Ulam&aacute;, the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, and
requested that high dignitary to open his home to the B&aacute;b.
The Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih dispatched a number of people close to
himself, amongst them his brother,<a name="FNanchor_CP_94" id="FNanchor_CP_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_CP_94" class="fnanchor">[CP]</a> some distance out of the
city to escort the B&aacute;b to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, and at the city-limits he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
himself welcomed the Visitor with respect and reverence.
He went far beyond the usual marks of cordial hospitality,
even to the extent of pouring water from a ewer over the
hands of the B&aacute;b, a task normally performed by attendants.</p>

<p>There were, by this time, an appreciable number of B&aacute;b&iacute;s
in I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, many of them natives of the city and some directed
there by the B&aacute;b Himself. Amongst the wider public the
fame of the B&aacute;b spread rapidly. There was one occasion
when people came to take away the water He had used for
His ablutions, so greatly did they value it. His host was
enthralled by the B&aacute;b. One night, after the evening meal, he
asked his Guest to write for him a commentary on the
S&uacute;rih of V'al-`A&#7779;r (Afternoon&mdash;Qur'&aacute;n ciii), one of the
shortest S&uacute;rihs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">By the afternoon!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Surely Man is in the way of loss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">save those who believe, and do righteous deeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">and counsel each other unto the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">and counsel each other to be steadfast.<a name="Nanchor_VIII3"
id="Nanchor_VIII3"></a><a href="#Note_VIII3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The B&aacute;b took up His pen and wrote His commentary,
there and then, to the astonishment and delight of all who
were present. It was past midnight when the assemblage
broke up. Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute;y-i-Hir&aacute;t&iacute;, one of the
divines of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, was so overcome by the power of the
B&aacute;b's pen and voice that he said with great feeling:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Peerless and unique as are the words which have streamed
from this pen, to be able to reveal, within so short a time
and in so legible a writing, so great a number of verses
as to equal a fourth, nay a third, of the Qur'&aacute;n, is in itself
an achievement such as no mortal, without the intervention
of God, could hope to perform.<a name="Nanchor_VIII4" id="Nanchor_VIII4"></a><a
href="#Note_VIII4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>People of all ranks flocked to the house of the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih.
Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n himself called there to meet the
B&aacute;b. He was a proud man and a powerful Governor, ruling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
over an important section of the realm. His visit to a young
Siyyid, hitherto unknown, indicates the measure of change
wrought in him by that one letter which he had received
from the B&aacute;b. Indeed, Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n was to become a
changed man under the influence of the B&aacute;b, who had been
a fugitive and an exile at his door. He now asked the B&aacute;b
for a treatise on 'Nubuvvat-i-<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;&#7779;&#7779;ih'&mdash;the specific station
and mission of the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad. Again surrounded
by a number of the leading divines of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, the B&aacute;b
wrote instantaneously the treatise which the Governor
desired. Within two hours He produced a disquisition of
fifty pages, superbly reasoned, proving unassailably the claim
and the achievement of Isl&aacute;m, and ending His theme on the
subject of the advent of the Q&aacute;'im and the Return of Im&aacute;m
&#7716;usayn (Rij`at-i-&#7716;usayn&iacute;). Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n's immediate
response was:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hear me! Members of this revered assembly, I take you
as my witnesses. Never until this day have I in my heart
been firmly convinced of the truth of Isl&aacute;m. I can henceforth,
thanks to this exposition penned by this Youth,
declare myself a firm believer in the Faith proclaimed by
the Apostle of God. I solemnly testify to my belief in the
reality of the superhuman power with which this Youth
is endowed, a power which no amount of learning can
ever impart.<a name="Nanchor_VIII5" id="Nanchor_VIII5"></a><a

<p>It was inevitable that soon the jealousy of the clergy would
be aroused. &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Mihd&iacute;,<a name="FNanchor_CQ_95" id="FNanchor_CQ_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_CQ_95" class="fnanchor">[CQ]</a> the son of the renowned
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m-i-Kalb&aacute;s&iacute;, began to use
the pulpit to insult and disparage the B&aacute;b. When &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; heard of the situation in I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, he wrote to
upbraid the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih for having harboured the B&aacute;b.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
The Grand Vizier was afraid that Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, because
of the confidence that Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h reposed in him,
might succeed in arranging a meeting between the B&aacute;b and
the monarch. The hold which &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; had on
Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h was chiefly due to the quasi-religious
nature of their relationship. He was the mur<span class="u">sh</span>id (spiritual
guide) and his king was the mur&iacute;d (disciple). The Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih,
still loyal, took no step in opposition, but endeavoured
to reduce the number of visitors.</p>

<p>As the clamour of the opponents increased, Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n thought of a scheme to silence them. He invited the
leading divines to meet the B&aacute;b at his home and argue their
case. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Asadu'll&aacute;h, the son of the celebrated &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad-B&aacute;qir-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;, declined the invitation
and advised the rest to do the same:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have sought to excuse myself and I would most certainly
urge you to do the same. I regard it as most unwise
of you to meet the Siyyid-i-B&aacute;b face to face. He will, no
doubt, reassert his claim and will, in support of his argument,
adduce whatever proof you may desire him to give,
and, without the least hesitation, will reveal as a testimony
to the truth he bears, verses of such a number as
would equal half the Qur'&aacute;n. In the end he will challenge
you in these words: 'Produce likewise, if ye are men of
truth.' We can in no wise successfully resist him. If we
disdain to answer him, our impotence will have been
exposed. If we, on the other hand, submit to his claim, we
shall not only be forfeiting our own reputation, our own
prerogatives and rights, but will have committed ourselves
to acknowledge any further claims that he may feel
inclined to make in the future.<a name="Nanchor_VIII6" id="Nanchor_VIII6"></a><a
href="#Note_VIII6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Only &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Ja`far-i-&Aacute;b&aacute;di'&iacute; took &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid
Asadu'll&aacute;h's advice and kept away. In the presence of
Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;asan-i-N&uacute;r&iacute; was the first to pose
a question. M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;asan was a follower of the I<span class="u">sh</span>r&aacute;q&iacute;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
school (Platonism), and his question concerned certain
elements of the philosophy of Mull&aacute; &#7778;adr&aacute; contained in his
celebrated work: the <i>&#7716;ikmatu'l-`Ar<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;yyah</i> (Celestial or
Divine Philosophy).<a name="Nanchor_VIII7" id="Nanchor_VIII7"></a><a
href="#Note_VIII7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The B&aacute;b's answers, even though
couched in simple terms, were beyond the grasp of M&iacute;rz&aacute;
&#7716;asan's mind. 'The Foolish One of the Learned' was the next
to face the B&aacute;b, and he began to probe into points of Islamic
jurisprudence. Unable to withstand the force of the B&aacute;b's
exposition he started a verbal assault which the Governor
quickly brought to an end. Sensing the mood of the audience,
Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n deemed it prudent that the B&aacute;b should
stay under the protection of his roof and not return to the
house of the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih, where he had been a guest for
forty days.</p>

<p>The next move came from the divines. Like their compatriots
in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, they gathered together and passed a
verdict on the B&aacute;b which carried with it the sentence of
death. Both &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Asadu'll&aacute;h-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute; and &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-Ja`far-i-&Aacute;b&aacute;di'&iacute; refused to be identified with it,
but the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih, with an eye to his position, wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I testify that in the course of my association with this
youth I have been unable to discover any act that would
in any way betray his repudiation of the doctrines of
Islam. On the contrary, I have known him as a pious and
loyal observer of its precepts. The extravagance of his
claims, however, and his disdainful contempt for the
things of the world, incline me to believe that he is devoid
of reason and judgment.<a name="Nanchor_VIII8" id="Nanchor_VIII8"></a><a
href="#Note_VIII8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h had already instructed Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n to send the B&aacute;b to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. The transforming
power of the B&aacute;b can now be discerned. Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n had served the Q&aacute;j&aacute;r monarch faithfully at all times.
His generalship had helped to secure Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h's
position. But, once conquered by the B&aacute;b and won over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
His Cause, Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n unhesitatingly availed himself
of the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h's command, not to send the B&aacute;b immediately to
the capital which would have put Him at the mercy of
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;, but to shield Him from His enemies.
Under public gaze the B&aacute;b was escorted out of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n,
guarded by five hundred horsemen. Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Imperative orders had been given that at the completion
of each farsang<a name="FNanchor_CR_96" id="FNanchor_CR_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_CR_96" class="fnanchor">[CR]</a> one hundred of this mounted escort
should return directly to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n. To the chief of the last
remaining contingent, a man in whom he placed implicit
confidence, the Mu`tamid confidentially intimated his
desire that at every mayd&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_CS_97" id="FNanchor_CS_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_CS_97" class="fnanchor">[CS]</a> twenty of the remaining
hundred should likewise be ordered by him to return to
the city. Of the twenty remaining horsemen, the Mu`tamid
directed that ten should be despatched to Ardist&aacute;n for the
purpose of collecting the taxes levied by the government,
and that the rest, all of whom should be of his tried and
most reliable men, should, by an unfrequented route,
bring the B&aacute;b back in disguise to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n. They were,
moreover, instructed so to regulate their march that
before dawn of the ensuing day the B&aacute;b should have
arrived at I&#7779;fah&aacute;n and should have been delivered into
his custody.... At an unsuspected hour, the B&aacute;b re-entered
the city, was directly conducted to the private
residence of the Mu`tamid, known by the name of `Im&aacute;rat-i-<span class="u">Kh</span>ur<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;d
[the Sun-House], and was introduced, through
a side entrance reserved for the Mu`tamid himself, into
his private apartments. The governor waited in person
on the B&aacute;b, served His meals, and provided whatever was
required for His comfort and safety.<a name="Nanchor_VIII9" id="Nanchor_VIII9"></a><a
href="#Note_VIII9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; states in <i>A Traveller's Narrative</i> that Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n gave secret orders for the return of the B&aacute;b when He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and His escort had reached M&uacute;r<span class="u">ch</span>ih-<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;r, some thirty-five
miles to the north of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n.<a name="Nanchor_VIII10"
id="Nanchor_VIII10"></a><a href="#Note_VIII10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Wild rumours began to circulate regarding the fate of the
B&aacute;b. It was believed that He had been executed in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n.
To allay the fears of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n the B&aacute;b allowed
Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-Kar&iacute;m-i-Qazv&iacute;n&iacute;, Siyyid &#7716;usayn-i-Yazd&iacute; and
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute; to be brought to meet Him. He
entrusted them with the task of transcribing His Writings.
Not long afterwards, He instructed them to tell the other
B&aacute;b&iacute;s who had moved to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n to leave the city and go
northwards, to K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n, or Qum or &#7788;ihr&aacute;n.</p>

<p>Not long before his death, Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n offered the
B&aacute;b all his immense fortune,<a name="FNanchor_CT_98" id="FNanchor_CT_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_CT_98" class="fnanchor">[CT]</a> and the resources of his
army which were considerable, that they might march
to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n and approach the person of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h.
Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n was certain that the monarch, who trusted
him completely, would listen to his plea, recognize the truth
of the Revelation of the B&aacute;b, and whole-heartedly lend his
support to the promotion of the new Faith. And Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n looked even beyond the frontiers of &Iacute;r&aacute;n, for he told
the B&aacute;b: '... I hope to be enabled to incline the hearts of
the rulers and kings of the earth to this most wondrous
Cause...' To this the B&aacute;b replied:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>May God requite you for your noble intentions. So lofty
a purpose is to Me even more precious than the act itself.
Your days and Mine are numbered, however; they are
too short to enable Me to witness, and allow you to
achieve, the realisation of your hopes. Not by the means
which you fondly imagine will an almighty Providence
accomplish the triumph of His Faith. Through the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>and lowly of this land, by the blood which these shall
have shed in His path, will the omnipotent Sovereign
ensure the preservation and consolidate the foundation
of His Cause. That same God will, in the world to come,
place upon your head the crown of immortal glory, and
will shower upon you His inestimable blessings. Of the
span of your earthly life there remain only three months
and nine days, after which you shall, with faith and
certitude, hasten to your eternal abode.<a name="Nanchor_VIII12"
id="Nanchor_VIII12"></a><a href="#Note_VIII12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The B&aacute;b, in His Tablet addressed to Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h,
states that He foretold, in a letter to two divines in Yazd,
the date of the death of Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, eighty-seven days
before it occurred. And He mentions that Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n had offered Him all that he possessed, even taking off
his rings and placing them before Him.</p>

<p>Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n had come to realize that his wealth was
the product of oppression. The B&aacute;b accepted both his
repentance and his wealth, then returned to him his riches
for his use until his death, which occurred in the month of
Rab&iacute;`u'l-Avval 1263 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> (February-March 1847 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>)</p>

<p>Even though in his will Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n left all his
property to the B&aacute;b, his nephew and successor, Gurg&iacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n,
appropriated everything after his death, and informed
Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h that the B&aacute;b was in I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, having been
kept, well-protected, by the late Governor in the seclusion
of `Im&aacute;rat-i-<span class="u">Kh</span>ur<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;d. Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h's trust in
Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n was not shaken. He felt certain that that
wise man and faithful servant had guarded the B&aacute;b against
all possible harm until an opportune time when a meeting
between himself and the B&aacute;b could be arranged. He issued
orders for the removal of the B&aacute;b to the capital in such wise
that He should not be recognized <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>Those four months in the private residence of the Governor
of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n were the calmest that the B&aacute;b was to experience
throughout His Ministry.<a name="Nanchor_VIII13" id="Nanchor_VIII13"></a><a

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;, the Grand Vizier and the spiritual guide
of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, has been called the Antichrist of the
B&aacute;b&iacute; Revelation.<a name="Nanchor_IX1" id="Nanchor_IX1"></a><a
href="#Note_IX1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He was a man bankrupt of ideas and bereft
of graces. A native of &Iacute;rav&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_CU_99" id="FNanchor_CU_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_CU_99" class="fnanchor">[CU]</a> in the Caucasus, his real name
was M&iacute;rz&aacute; `Abb&aacute;s. From the day he learned of the advent
of the B&aacute;b, he bore Him intense enmity which never abated.
It was he who prevented a meeting between the B&aacute;b and
Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, when, by the direct order of the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h
himself, the B&aacute;b was moved from I&#7779;fah&aacute;n and it seemed that
the cherished hope of Man&uacute;<span class="u">ch</span>ihr <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n for their meeting
would at last be realized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the instructions of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, Gurg&iacute;n
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n gave the custody of the B&aacute;b to Mu&#7717;ammad Big-i-<span class="u">Ch</span>&aacute;p&aacute;r<span class="u">ch</span>&iacute;
(the chief courier). Mu&#7717;ammad Big belonged to
the sect of Ahl-i-&#7716;aqq (the People of Truth), commonly
known as the `Al&iacute;yu'll&aacute;h&iacute;, who have had a long tradition
of tolerance, liberalism and rectitude.<a name="Nanchor_IX2" id="Nanchor_IX2"></a><a
href="#Note_IX2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; states
in <i>A Traveller's Narrative</i> that the guards who escorted the
B&aacute;b, on this journey to the north, were Nu&#7779;ayr&iacute; horsemen.
Nu&#7779;ayr&iacute;s and `Al&iacute;yu'll&aacute;h&iacute;s are almost identical.</p>

<p>The first town on their road to the capital was K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n.
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; J&aacute;n&iacute;, the B&aacute;b&iacute; merchant of that town, had dreamt
that he beheld the B&aacute;b approaching K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n by the `A&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;r
(Druggist) Gate. Keeping watch by that gate, on the eve of
Naw-R&uacute;z, he saw his dream fulfilled, for there was the B&aacute;b
on horseback coming towards K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n. As he went forward
to kiss His stirrup, the B&aacute;b told him: 'We are to be your
Guest for three nights.'<a name="Nanchor_IX3" id="Nanchor_IX3"></a><a
href="#Note_IX3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This was exactly what he had heard
the B&aacute;b say to him in his dream. Mu&#7717;ammad Big, noticing
the warmth of their greeting, thought that the young
Siyyid in his charge and the citizen of K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n were friends
of long standing, and he readily agreed to let the B&aacute;b stay
in the house of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; J&aacute;n&iacute;. A colleague, however,
refused to give his consent; he had been told, he said, not to
allow the B&aacute;b to enter any city <i>en route</i>. After a lengthy
argument Mu&#7717;ammad Big succeeded in persuading this
colleague to withdraw his objection. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; J&aacute;n&iacute; was
prepared to invite the whole escort to be his guests, but the
B&aacute;b did not permit it. Siyyid &#7716;usayn-i-Yazd&iacute;, who had
already proceeded to K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n as bidden by the B&aacute;b, that night
attained His presence. While the B&aacute;b was dictating a Tablet
to Siyyid &#7716;usayn, in honour of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; J&aacute;n&iacute;, a friend of
the K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n&iacute; merchant was announced. His name was Siyyid
`Abdu'l-B&aacute;q&iacute;, and he was reputed for his erudition; he sat
and listened to the B&aacute;b, but failed to be moved by what he
heard and noticed. Some days after the B&aacute;b left K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
learned who that young Siyyid was. He was sorrow-stricken
that he had not recognized the powers of the B&aacute;b and withdrew
from society for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>On the second day after Naw-R&uacute;z the B&aacute;b rejoined His
escort to journey towards Qum,<a name="FNanchor_CV_100" id="FNanchor_CV_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_CV_100" class="fnanchor">[CV]</a> the next city on the road
to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. They did not enter Qum but went on to the
village of Qumr&uacute;d, where the entire population was `Al&iacute;yu'll&aacute;h&iacute;.
Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the invitation of the headman of the village, the
B&aacute;b tarried one night in that place and was touched by
the warmth and spontaneity of the reception which those
simple folk had accorded Him. Ere He resumed His
journey, He invoked the blessings of the Almighty in their
behalf and cheered their hearts with assurances of His
appreciation and love.<a name="Nanchor_IX4" id="Nanchor_IX4"></a><a
href="#Note_IX4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Two days later, in the afternoon of March 28th, they
reached the fortress of Kin&aacute;r-Gird, only twenty-eight miles
from &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. The long journey from I&#7779;fah&aacute;n was almost
over. But here &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; intervened and sent instructions
to Mu&#7717;ammad Big to take the B&aacute;b to the village
of Kulayn, where the great <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah jurisconsult, Mu&#7717;ammad
ibn-i-Ya`q&uacute;b was born and is buried.<a name="FNanchor_CW_101" id="FNanchor_CW_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_CW_101" class="fnanchor">[CW]</a> &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;
himself was the owner of Kulayn, and a tent which belonged
to him was pitched outside the village to accommodate the
B&aacute;b. It was a delectable spot with lush vegetation, orchards
and running brooks. The B&aacute;b was delighted, but uncertainties
of the future overshadowed Him. Days passed without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
further instruction from &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. Siyyid &#7716;usayn-i-Yazd&iacute; and
his brother Siyyid &#7716;asan, as well as Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-Kar&iacute;m-i-Qazv&iacute;n&iacute;
and <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute;, came to Kulayn to
attend the B&aacute;b. And from &#7788;ihr&aacute;n came Mull&aacute; Mihd&iacute;y-i-<span class="u">Kh</span>u'&iacute;
accompanied by Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Mihd&iacute;y-i-Kind&iacute;,
the latter bearing a letter and presents from Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h.
Receiving them brought the B&aacute;b untold joy.<a name="Nanchor_IX5"
id="Nanchor_IX5"></a><a href="#Note_IX5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>According to <i>A Traveller's Narrative</i> the B&aacute;b's sojourn in
Kulayn was lengthened into twenty days.<a name="Nanchor_IX6"
id="Nanchor_IX6"></a><a href="#Note_IX6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> During this
time a remarkable incident occurred which Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-Kar&iacute;m
has thus related:</p>

<blockquote><p>My companions and I were fast asleep in the vicinity of
the tent of the B&aacute;b when the trampling of horsemen suddenly
awakened us. We were soon informed that the tent
of the B&aacute;b was vacant and that those who had gone out in
search of Him had failed to find Him. We heard Mu&#7717;ammad
Big remonstrate with the guards. 'Why feel disturbed?'
he pleaded. 'Are not His magnanimity and
nobleness of soul sufficiently established in your eyes to
convince you that He will never, for the sake of His own
safety, consent to involve others in embarrassment? He,
no doubt, must have retired, in the silence of this moonlit
night, to a place where He can seek undisturbed communion
with God. He will unquestionably return to His
tent. He will never desert us.' In his eagerness to reassure
his colleagues, Mu&#7717;ammad Big set out on foot
along the road leading to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. I, too, with my companions,
followed him. Shortly after, the rest of the
guards were seen, each on horseback, marching behind
us. We had covered about a mayd&aacute;n when, by the dim
light of the early dawn, we discerned in the distance the
lonely figure of the B&aacute;b. He was coming towards us
from the direction of &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. 'Did you believe Me to
have escaped?' were His words to Mu&#7717;ammad Big as He
approached him. 'Far be it from me,' was the instant reply
as he flung himself at the feet of the B&aacute;b, 'to entertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>such thoughts.' Mu&#7717;ammad Big was too much awed by
the serene majesty which that radiant face revealed that
morning to venture any further remark. A look of confidence
had settled upon His countenance; His words
were invested with such transcendent power, that a
feeling of profound reverence wrapped our very souls.
No one dared to question Him as to the course of so
remarkable a change in His speech and demeanour. Nor
did He Himself choose to allay our curiosity and wonder.<a name="Nanchor_IX7"
id="Nanchor_IX7"></a><a href="#Note_IX7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nearly three weeks had passed since His arrival at Kulayn
when the B&aacute;b wrote to Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h to ask for a meeting.
And now &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; made the move which
consigned the B&aacute;b to prison for the rest of his days. According
to <i>A Traveller's Narrative</i>, he persuasively told Mu&#7717;ammad
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h:</p>

<blockquote><p>The royal cavalcade is on the point of starting, and to
engage in such matters as the present will conduce to the
disruption of the kingdom. Neither is there any doubt
that the most notable doctors of the capital also will
behave after the fashion of the doctors of Isfah&aacute;n, which
thing will be the cause of a popular outbreak, or that,
according to the religion of the immaculate Im&aacute;m, they
will regard the blood of this Seyyid as of no account,
yea, as more lawful than mother's milk. The imperial
train is prepared for travel, neither is there hindrance
or impediment in view. There is no doubt that the
presence of the B&aacute;b will be the cause of the gravest trouble
and the greatest mischief. Therefore, on the spur of the
moment, the wisest plan is this:&mdash;to place this person in
the Castle of M&aacute;k&uacute; during the period of absence of the
royal train from the seat of the imperial throne, and to
defer the obtaining of an audience to the time of return.<a name="Nanchor_IX8"
id="Nanchor_IX8"></a><a href="#Note_IX8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>M&iacute;rz&aacute; Abu'l-Fa&#7693;l states that &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; played on the
fears of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h by instancing in particular the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
rebellion in <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n of Mu&#7717;ammad-&#7716;asan <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the
S&aacute;l&aacute;r, and the earlier defiance of the central government by
&#7716;asan-`Ali <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, Aga Khan I.<a name="FNanchor_CX_102" id="FNanchor_CX_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_CX_102" class="fnanchor">[CX]</a> Whatever arguments the
Grand Vizier used, he succeeded in preventing a meeting
between the B&aacute;b and Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h in that spring of
1847. And it was never to take place.</p>

<p>In April, the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h sent a reply to the letter of the B&aacute;b
which, according to <i>A Traveller's Narrative</i>, was couched in
these terms:</p>

<blockquote><p>Since the royal train is on the verge of departure from
Teher&aacute;n, to meet in a befitting manner is impossible. Do
you go to M&aacute;k&uacute; and there abide and rest for a while,
engaged in praying for our victorious state; and we have
arranged that under all circumstances they shall shew
you attention and respect. When we return from travel
we will summon you specially.<a name="Nanchor_IX9" id="Nanchor_IX9"></a><a
href="#Note_IX9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am, in his narrative, gives this version of the
contents of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h's letter:</p>

<blockquote><p>Much as we desire to meet you, we find ourself unable, in
view of our immediate departure from our capital, to
receive you befittingly in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. We have signified our
desire that you be conducted to M&aacute;h-K&uacute;, and have issued
the necessary instructions to `Al&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the warden of the
castle, to treat you with respect and consideration. It is
our hope and intention to summon you to this place upon
our return to the seat of our government, at which time
we shall definitely pronounce our judgment. We trust that
we have caused you no disappointment, and that you will
at no time hesitate to inform us in case any grievances
befall you. We fain would hope that you will continue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>to pray for our well-being and for the prosperity of our
realm.<a name="Nanchor_IX10" id="Nanchor_IX10"></a><a
href="#Note_IX10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#7716;usayn <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the Governor of F&aacute;rs, was attending the
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h in the capital at the very time that &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;
blocked the path of the B&aacute;b and prevented His entry into
&#7788;ihr&aacute;n.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 10<br />
WHERE THE ARAS FLOWS</h2>

<p>M&aacute;h-K&uacute;,<a name="FNanchor_CY_103" id="FNanchor_CY_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_CY_103" class="fnanchor">[CY]</a> a town of the province of &Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>arb&aacute;yj&aacute;n, is in the
extreme north-west of &Iacute;r&aacute;n, close to the point where the
Russo-Turkish frontiers meet. Within a short distance of the
town of M&aacute;h-K&uacute; and its bleak fortress perched on a mountain
peak above, the Aras flows, the Araxes of the Greeks.
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; contrived to have the B&aacute;b banished to this
remote corner of the land, well away from the capital, and
well away from the areas where His Faith was born and
nurtured. But the road to M&aacute;h-K&uacute; was through Tabr&iacute;z,
the second city of the realm and the seat of the Crown Prince.</p>

<p>The same horsemen, still under the command of Mu&#7717;ammad
Big, were given the task of escorting the B&aacute;b to Tabr&iacute;z.
They had, by then, become greatly devoted to Him. His
utter kindness coupled with His majesty of bearing had
totally captivated them. Two of the followers of the B&aacute;b
were allowed to remain with Him: Siyyid &#7716;usayn-i-Yazd&iacute;
and his brother, Siyyid &#7716;asan.</p>

<p>On the road north, one of the halting-places was the
village of S&iacute;y&aacute;h-Dih&aacute;n, close by Qazv&iacute;n. There the B&aacute;b
addressed a letter to the Grand Vizier, and also wrote to
some of the leading divines of Qazv&iacute;n, including the father
and the uncle of Qurratu'l-`Ayn. A number of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s
attained His presence in the village of S&iacute;y&aacute;h-Dih&aacute;n during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
His one night there, and among these was Mull&aacute; Iskandar
of Zanj&aacute;n, the same man who had visited <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z as &#7716;ujjat's
emissary to learn what he could about the B&aacute;b. Now the
B&aacute;b entrusted to him a letter for &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Sulaym&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-Af<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;r,
who happened to be in Zanj&aacute;n; he had been a fervent
supporter of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;. To him the B&aacute;b
wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>He whose virtues the late siyyid unceasingly extolled,
and to the approach of whose Revelation he continually
alluded, is now revealed. I am that promised One. Arise
and deliver Me from the hand of the oppressor.<a name="Nanchor_X1"
id="Nanchor_X1"></a><a href="#Note_X1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Sulaym&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n received the letter within three days,
but did not heed it and left for the capital.</p>

<p>At that time Hujjat<a name="FNanchor_CZ_104" id="FNanchor_CZ_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_CZ_104" class="fnanchor">[CZ]</a> was in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, kept there under surveillance.
But the moment he heard of the B&aacute;b's letter to
Sulaym&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, he sent a message to the B&aacute;b&iacute;s of Zanj&aacute;n
to march out and rescue the B&aacute;b. A sizable number of
B&aacute;b&iacute;s from &#7716;ujjat's native town and from Qazv&iacute;n and
&#7788;ihr&aacute;n came together and made a concerted effort to carry
out their daring scheme. At midnight they reached the spot
where the B&aacute;b and His escort were bivouacked. The guards
were asleep and there was every opportunity to escape. But
the B&aacute;b told His would-be rescuers that He would not run
away. 'The mountains of A<span class="u">dh</span>irb&aacute;yj&aacute;n too have their
claims.'<a name="Nanchor_X2" id="Nanchor_X2"></a><a
href="#Note_X2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Before His mission reached its end Mu&#7717;ammad Big came
to believe in the B&aacute;b.<a name="FNanchor_DA_105" id="FNanchor_DA_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_DA_105" class="fnanchor">[DA]</a> Grief-stricken he went to the B&aacute;b
and asked to be forgiven: 'The journey from I&#7779;fah&aacute;n has been
long and arduous. I have failed to do my duty and to serve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>You as I ought. I crave Your forgiveness, and pray You to
vouchsafe me Your blessings.' To this the B&aacute;b replied:
'Be assured. I account you a member of My fold. They who
embrace My Cause will eternally bless and glorify you, will
extol your conduct and exalt your name.'<a name="Nanchor_X3"
id="Nanchor_X3"></a><a href="#Note_X3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Later, Mu&#7717;ammad
Big met &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; J&aacute;n&iacute; once again, and recounted for
him the story of that journey to Tabr&iacute;z. The K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n&iacute; merchant
included Mu&#7717;ammad Big's story in his chronicle,
and M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;usayn-i-Hamad&aacute;n&iacute;, the author of the <i>T&aacute;r&iacute;kh-i-Jad&iacute;d</i>
(<i>The New History</i>) in turn made use of it in his own
work:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... we proceeded to M&iacute;l&aacute;n,<a name="FNanchor_DB_106" id="FNanchor_DB_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_DB_106" class="fnanchor">[DB]</a> where many of the inhabitants
came to see His Holiness, and were filled with
wonder at the majesty and dignity of that Lord of mankind.
In the morning, as we were setting out from M&iacute;l&aacute;n,
an old woman brought a scald-headed child, whose head
was so covered with scabs that it was white down to the
neck, and entreated His Holiness to heal him. The guards
would have forbidden her, but His Holiness prevented
them, and called the child to him. Then he drew a handkerchief
over its head and repeated certain words; which
he had no sooner done than the child was healed. And in
that place about two hundred persons believed and underwent
a true and sincere conversion ... on leaving M&iacute;l&aacute;n,
while we were on the road His Holiness suddenly urged
his horse into so swift a gallop that all the horsemen
composing the escort were filled with amazement, seeing
that his steed was the leanest of all. We galloped after
him as hard as we could, but were unable to come up with
him, though the horsemen were filled with apprehension
lest he should effect his escape. Presently he reined in his
horse of his own accord, and, so soon as we came up to
him, said with a smile, 'Were I desirous of escaping, you
could not prevent me.' And indeed it was even as he said;
had he desired in the least degree to escape, none could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>have prevented him, and under all circumstances he
shewed himself endowed with more than human strength.
For example, we were all practised horsemen inured to
travel, yet, by reason of the cold and our weariness, we
were at times hardly able to keep our saddles, while he,
on the other hand, during all this period shewed no sign
of faintness or weariness, but, from the time when he
mounted till he alighted at the end of the stage, would
not so much as change his posture or shift his seat.<a name="Nanchor_X4"
id="Nanchor_X4"></a><a href="#Note_X4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The stage beyond the village of M&iacute;l&aacute;n was the city of
Tabr&iacute;z itself. As the news spread that the B&aacute;b was approaching
the city, the B&aacute;b&iacute;s there tried to go out to meet him, but
they were stopped and sent back. Only a youth managed to
break through the cordon of guards and soldiers. Barefooted,
he ran more than a mile till he reached the B&aacute;b and
His escort. Such was the state of his ecstasy that he flung
himself forward in the path of one of the horsemen, caught
the hem of his cloak and eagerly and fervently kissed his
stirrup. Addressing them all, he cried out: 'Ye are the companions
of my Well-Beloved. I cherish you as the apple of
my eye.'<a name="Nanchor_X5" id="Nanchor_X5"></a><a
href="#Note_X5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And when he came into the presence of the B&aacute;b,
he fell prostrate on the ground and unrestrainedly wept.
The B&aacute;b dismounted, raised him up, embraced him and
wiped his tears.</p>

<p>The B&aacute;b's entry into Tabr&iacute;z, the scene three years later
of His martyrdom in its public square, bears close resemblance
to the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday,
less than a week before He was led to Golgotha to be
crucified.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And they that went before, and they that followed, cried,
saying, Hosanna! Blessed <i>is</i> he that cometh in the name of
the Lord!</p>

<p>Blessed <i>be</i> the kingdom of our father David, that
cometh in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!<a name="FNanchor_DC_107" id="FNanchor_DC_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_DC_107" class="fnanchor">[DC]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>That is how St. Mark recounts the joy of the people who
gave Jesus a regal welcome into Jerusalem.</p>

<p>When the B&aacute;b was brought into Tabr&iacute;z the streets were
crowded, and amongst the surging mass were B&aacute;b&iacute;s who
had been deprived of coming close to their Master; but vast
numbers were there who were not His followers. Those
narrow thoroughfares echoed with the cry of `All&aacute;h-u-Akbar'&mdash;God
is the Greatest&mdash;the opening line of the
A<span class="u">dh</span>&aacute;n, the call to prayer which every devout Muslim
repeats time and again in the course of his devotions. Officials
were alarmed by this wonderful and unprecedented reception,
and sent town criers to warn the people against
attempting to gain access to the Siyyid-i-B&aacute;b.</p>

<p>`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; states that the B&aacute;b was kept for forty days
in Tabr&iacute;z.<a name="Nanchor_X6" id="Nanchor_X6"></a><a
href="#Note_X6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> During that time He was strictly secluded, and
His only visitors were &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute;y-i-M&iacute;l&aacute;n&iacute;, a
well-known merchant, and &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; `Al&iacute;-`Askar.<a name="FNanchor_DD_108" id="FNanchor_DD_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_DD_108" class="fnanchor">[DD]</a> When they
first approached the house where the B&aacute;b was lodged,
guards stopped them, but Siyyid Hasan asserted the authority
of the B&aacute;b and gained them admittance. After that no one
ever tried to bar their way, and they attained the presence
of the B&aacute;b several times.</p>

<p>At last came the orders for the removal of the B&aacute;b to
M&aacute;h-K&uacute;. That town was the birthplace of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;,
although he is generally known as &Iacute;rav&aacute;n&iacute;<a name="FNanchor_DE_109" id="FNanchor_DE_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_DE_109" class="fnanchor">[DE]</a> because his
family originated there. The vast majority of the inhabitants
of M&aacute;h-K&uacute; and its environs were Kurds who were Sunn&iacute;
by persuasion. `Al&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the warden of the castle, was a
Kurd, simple, rough and uncouth. He was arrogantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
unbending at the start of the B&aacute;b's incarceration, and would
not allow any follower of the B&aacute;b to stay in the town, even
for one night. When <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute; reached
M&aacute;h-K&uacute; he found that the only shelter available to him was
a mosque outside the town. But he was able to meet and
exchange letters and messages with Siyyid &#7716;asan, who came
into the town each day with a guard to buy provisions, and
thus for a while he maintained a link between the B&aacute;b and
His people.</p>

<p>But one day the B&aacute;b advised Siyyid &#7716;asan that these
secret contacts with <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan were to end; He Himself
would tell `Ali <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n to permit visitors to come and go in
peace. Both men were greatly astonished, since they knew
well the character and attitude of the warden, who had even
tried to prevent the people of M&aacute;h-K&uacute; from coming to the
foot of the mountain to obtain a glimpse of the B&aacute;b. By
now the B&aacute;b had won the love and esteem of these hardened
frontiersmen, who had shown such marked hostility when
He was first brought to their fortress, nor could `Ali <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n
prevent their gathering daily at the mountain's base to gaze
upwards in the hope of receiving His blessing.</p>

<p>At an early hour on the morning following the B&aacute;b's
advice to Siyyid &#7716;asan, the inmates of the castle were startled
by an incessant and agitated knocking. It was `Ali <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n,
peremptorily pounding the gate and shouting at the guardsmen
for admittance. A guard rushed in to say that the warden
wished to come immediately into the presence of the B&aacute;b.
Siyyid &#7716;usayn presented the request, and the B&aacute;b replied that
He would receive `Ali <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n at once. The warden was visibly
shaking, obviously caught up by some tremendous emotion.
He threw himself at the feet of the B&aacute;b and begged to be
relieved of his misery:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Deliver me from my perplexity. I adjure You, by the
Prophet of God, Your illustrious Ancestor, to dissipate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>my doubts, for their weight has well-nigh crushed my
heart. I was riding through the wilderness and was
approaching the gate of the town, when, it being the
hour of dawn, my eyes suddenly beheld You standing by
the side of the river engaged in offering Your prayer. With
outstretched arms and upraised eyes, You were invoking
the name of God. I stood still and watched You. I was
waiting for You to terminate Your devotions that I
might approach and rebuke You for having ventured to
leave the castle without my leave. In Your communion
with God, You seemed so wrapt in worship that You were
utterly forgetful of Yourself. I quietly approached You;
in Your state of rapture, You remained wholly unaware
of my presence. I was suddenly seized with great fear and
recoiled at the thought of awakening You from Your
ecstasy. I decided to leave You, to proceed to the guards
and to reprove them for their negligent conduct. I soon
found out, to my amazement, that both the outer and
inner gates were closed. They were opened at my request,
I was ushered into Your presence, and now find You, to
my wonder, seated before me. I am utterly confounded.
I know not whether my reason has deserted me.' The B&aacute;b
answered and said: 'What you have witnessed is true and
undeniable. You belittled this Revelation and have contemptuously
disdained its Author. God, the All-Merciful,
desiring not to afflict you with His punishment, has
willed to reveal to your eyes the Truth. By His Divine
interposition, He has instilled into your heart the love
of His chosen One, and caused you to recognise the
unconquerable power of His Faith.'<a name="Nanchor_X7" id="Nanchor_X7"></a><a
href="#Note_X7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>All the arrogance of the warden left him. He was totally
conquered. He became humble. The first words that he
uttered were:</p>

<blockquote><p>A poor man, a <span class="u">sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>, is yearning to attain Your presence.
He lives in a masjid [mosque] outside the gate of M&aacute;h-K&uacute;.
I pray You that I myself be allowed to bring him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>this place that he may meet You. By this act I hope that
my evil deeds may be forgiven, that I may be enabled to
wash away the stains of my cruel behaviour toward Your
friends.<a name="Nanchor_X8" id="Nanchor_X8"></a><a
href="#Note_X8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>He went away and returned with <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute;.</p>

<p>`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n's change of heart and attitude radically altered
the situation. The prison gates no longer barred the B&aacute;b
from His followers. B&aacute;b&iacute;s came from everywhere to attain
the presence of their Lord, among them Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, the
B&aacute;bu'l-B&aacute;b. The B&aacute;b received him at the gate of the castle
and celebrated the Feast of Naw-R&uacute;z with him. Ere his
departure, the B&aacute;b directed him to visit Tabr&iacute;z and other
towns of the province of &Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>arb&aacute;yj&aacute;n, and then proceed
to Zanj&aacute;n, Qazv&iacute;n, &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, and finally to the province of
M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n.</p>

<p>`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n's devotion to the person of the B&aacute;b increased
day by day. He did everything possible to mitigate the
rigours of prison life. Every Friday he came up the mountain
to offer his homage. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; was alarmed by
the news reaching him from M&aacute;h-K&uacute;, and so was the
Russian Minister in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, Prince Dimitri Ivanovich
Dolgorukov. In dispatches to Count Nesselrode, the
Minister of Foreign Affairs, dated February 4th and December
24th 1848, he mentions that, in the previous year, the
B&aacute;b had been removed from the vicinity of the Russian
border by his demand.<a name="Nanchor_X9" id="Nanchor_X9"></a><a
href="#Note_X9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This assertion is borne out by a
letter of Mull&aacute; A&#7717;mad-i-Ibd&aacute;l, one of the Letters of the
Living, written when he was in K&aacute;&#7827;imayn, close to Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d.
It is not clear to whom the letter is addressed, most probably
to one of the uncles of the B&aacute;b.<a name="Nanchor_X10" id="Nanchor_X10"></a><a
href="#Note_X10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Mull&aacute; A&#7717;mad writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>These days, God willing, I intend to go and attain the
presence of my Lord.... These days pilgrims arrived
here from Ur&uacute;m&iacute;yyih. I sought the news of my Lord
from them. They said that He was in a district of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>Ur&uacute;m&iacute;yyih, called <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&uacute;m [<span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q?]. The Governor of
Ur&uacute;m&iacute;yyih wished, at first, to keep Him in the town itself,
but the clerics had taken fright lest disturbances might
arise, and had refused their consent; curses of God rest
upon them. It is said that the Governor is acting with
kindness, and from the towns of A<span class="u">dh</span>arb&aacute;yj&aacute;n people
come in large groups, attain His presence and return
believers. According to what has been related there is a
tremendous upsurge, that is to say, many, many people
have become devoted to Him.... And as to the reason
for the departure of <span class="u">Dh</span>ikr, on Him be peace from M&aacute;h-K&uacute;,
it is this, that the Russian Envoy had heard that He
was in M&aacute;h-K&uacute;, and, being afraid of disturbance, told the
Vizier, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;: 'Send the <span class="u">Dh</span>ikr, on whom be
peace, to some other area of your realms, because M&aacute;h-K&uacute;
is on the frontier and close to our territory, and we
are afraid of disturbances; a few years ago, a certain
Mull&aacute; &#7778;&aacute;diq claimed to be the deputy [of the Im&aacute;m] and
within a month gathered 30,000 followers round him.'
Russians had witnessed that and had taken fright.</p></blockquote>

<p>`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; states that the B&aacute;b's incarceration in the
castle of M&aacute;h-K&uacute; lasted nine months. According to Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am,
on the twentieth day after Naw-R&uacute;z (April 9th
1848), He left that mountain fastness on the Russian and
Turkish frontiers.<a name="Nanchor_X11" id="Nanchor_X11"></a><a
href="#Note_X11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>At M&aacute;h-K&uacute; the B&aacute;b revealed the <i>Dal&aacute;'il-i-Sab`ih</i> (The
Seven Proofs) and began the composition of the Persian
<i>Bay&aacute;n</i><a name="FNanchor_DF_110" id="FNanchor_DF_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_DF_110" class="fnanchor">[DF]</a> (Exposition or Utterance). Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have heard <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute; bear witness to
the following: 'The voice of the B&aacute;b, as He dictated the
teachings and principles of His Faith, could be clearly
heard by those who were dwelling at the foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
mountain. The melody of His chanting, the rhythmic
flow of the verses which streamed from His lips caught our
ears and penetrated into our very souls. Mountain and
valley re-echoed the majesty of His voice. Our hearts
vibrated in their depths to the appeal of His utterance.'<a name="Nanchor_X12"

<h2>CHAPTER 11<br />
THE GRIEVOUS MOUNTAIN</h2>

<span class="i2">They have their day and cease to be:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They are but broken lights of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, O Lord, art more than they.<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>The man chosen by &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; to take the B&aacute;b away
from the castle of M&aacute;h-K&uacute; was Ri&#7693;&aacute;-Qul&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-Af<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;r,
an officer with the rank of Sart&iacute;p (brigadier, in today's
usage). He was the son of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Sulaym&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the official
who, in Zanj&aacute;n, failed to heed the B&aacute;b's message to him.
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Sulaym&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n was intensely devoted to Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;,
who had told him that he would live to see the
advent of the Q&aacute;'im; he often expressed surprise that the
Q&aacute;'im had not appeared for him to recognize, despite this
unequivocal promise. Although he met the B&aacute;b in Mecca,
he attached himself to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Kar&iacute;m <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-Kirm&aacute;n&iacute;
and refused to listen to the B&aacute;b&iacute;s. His devotion to
Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im was of such a character that, having obtained
the hand of a daughter of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im for his son, he began
his day by paying his respects in person to his daughter-in-law.
It was this son who was entrusted with the task of
moving the B&aacute;b from M&aacute;h-K&uacute; to Ur&uacute;m&iacute;yyih and <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q.<a name="FNanchor_DG_111" id="FNanchor_DG_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_DG_111" class="fnanchor">[DG]</a>
And soon he too became captivated by the Prisoner in his
charge. Eventually, Ri&#7693;&aacute;-Qul&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n became an avowed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
zealous B&aacute;b&iacute;, and broke away from his father, who persisted
in his hostility to the B&aacute;b.</p>

<p>The castle of <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q is in the neighbourhood of Ur&uacute;m&iacute;yyih,
known today as Ri&#7693;&aacute;'&iacute;yyih. Its warden, Ya&#7717;y&aacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n,
was a Kurdish chieftain, whose sister was married to
Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h. The son of this union was called `Abb&aacute;s
M&iacute;rz&aacute;, after the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h's own father, and bore also his title,
N&aacute;yibu's-Sal&#7789;anih (Viceroy or Regent). Because this child
was such a favourite of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, the mother of the
heir to the throne, N&aacute;&#7779;iri'd-D&iacute;n M&iacute;rz&aacute;, was exceedingly
jealous of him. Her jealousy put his life in jeopardy after the
death of his father, but Colonel Farrant's intervention saved
him.<a name="FNanchor_DH_112" id="FNanchor_DH_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_DH_112" class="fnanchor">[DH]</a> He was exiled to Qum, but even then he was not
secure, for he was accused of being in league with the
B&aacute;b&iacute;s. M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;usayn-i-Mutavall&iacute; (Custodian) of Qum was
forced, under torture, to sign a confession implicating
`Abb&aacute;s M&iacute;rz&aacute; in faked B&aacute;b&iacute; plots.<a name="FNanchor_DI_113" id="FNanchor_DI_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_DI_113" class="fnanchor">[DI]</a> This unfortunate prince
spent many years of his life in exile, mostly in `Ir&aacute;q. He was
eventually allowed to return to &Iacute;r&aacute;n and was given the title
of Mulk-&Aacute;r&aacute;; but he was always close to misfortune and
danger.</p>

<p>Ya&#7717;y&aacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the warden of <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q, was harsh and unpredictable,
but before long he too felt unable to keep the
gates of his castle closed against the B&aacute;b&iacute;s. The same power,
which had held `Al&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n of M&aacute;h-K&uacute; spellbound, captured
the heart of Ya&#7717;y&aacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n. So many B&aacute;b&iacute;s came to <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q
that it was impossible to house them and rooms had to be
found for them in Isk&iacute;-<span class="u">Sh</span>ahr, which was not far away. Food
and all other necessities were purchased in Isk&iacute;-<span class="u">Sh</span>ahr. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
some honey was bought there for the B&aacute;b, but He found the
quality to be inferior and the price exorbitant and had it
returned.</p>

<blockquote><p>Honey of a superior quality [He said] could no doubt have
been purchased at a lower price. I who am your example
have been a merchant by profession. It behoves you in
all your transactions to follow in My way. You must
neither defraud your neighbour nor allow him to defraud
you. Such was the way of your Master. The shrewdest
and ablest of men were unable to deceive Him, nor did He
on His part choose to act ungenerously towards the meanest
and most helpless of creatures.<a name="Nanchor_XI1" id="Nanchor_XI1"></a><a
href="#Note_XI1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="u">Kh</span>uy was another town of &Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>arb&aacute;yj&aacute;n which was not
far from <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q. Not long had passed since the B&aacute;b's
arrival at <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q when <span class="u">Kh</span>uy became aware that a number
of its prominent citizens among the siyyids, divines and
officials had become B&aacute;b&iacute;s. M&iacute;rz&aacute; Asadu'll&aacute;h, on whom the
B&aacute;b conferred the designation of Dayy&aacute;n,<a name="Nanchor_XI2"
id="Nanchor_XI2"></a><a href="#Note_XI2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was one of them.
Dayy&aacute;n means the conqueror or the judge. M&iacute;rz&aacute; Asadu'll&aacute;h,
a proud man, high in the service of the government, and a
man of vast learning who wielded a fluent pen,<a name="FNanchor_DJ_114" id="FNanchor_DJ_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_DJ_114" class="fnanchor">[DJ]</a> had for
long withstood the attempts of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s to convert him.
Not only did he refuse to yield any ground to them, he also
proved a vociferous antagonist. Then he had a dream which
induced him to write to the B&aacute;b. And when he received the
answer to his letter he gave the B&aacute;b his allegiance with a
zeal and fervour that thoroughly alarmed his father, who
was a personal friend of the Grand Vizier. He wrote to
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;, expatiating on his son's bewitchment and
deploring his grave aberrations.<a name="FNanchor_DK_115" id="FNanchor_DK_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_DK_115" class="fnanchor">[DK]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Once again &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; found himself thwarted.
The Faith of the B&aacute;b was spreading and he could not contain
it. And now the Grand Vizier had the additional anxiety
of watching the rapid deterioration of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h's
health. The monarch was only forty years old, but as a
sufferer from gout his malady was wearing him down.</p>

<p>At <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q itself a dervish arrived from India. Who he
truly was, no one knew and no one knows even now. The
B&aacute;b gave him the name Qahru'll&aacute;h (the Wrath of God). All
that this dervish would say about himself was:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the days when I occupied the exalted position of a
navv&aacute;b in India, the B&aacute;b appeared to me in a vision. He
gazed at me and won my heart completely. I arose, and
had started to follow Him, when He looked at me intently
and said: 'Divest yourself of your gorgeous attire, depart
from your native land, and hasten on foot to meet Me in
&Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>irb&aacute;yj&aacute;n. In <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q you will attain your heart's desire.'
I followed His directions and have now reached my goal.<a name="Nanchor_XI4"
id="Nanchor_XI4"></a><a href="#Note_XI4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The B&aacute;b instructed him to go back to his native land, the
same way he had come, as a dervish and on foot. Qahru'll&aacute;h
would have no companion on that long journey back. His
fate remains a mystery, just as does the fate of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Sa`&iacute;d,
the Indian Letter of the Living.</p>

<p>The B&aacute;b had been in <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q for three months when &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; decided He should be taken, once more, to
Tabr&iacute;z. Before the summons came, the B&aacute;b sent away those
B&aacute;b&iacute;s who had congregated in and around <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q; among
them was the redoubtable `A&#7827;&iacute;m.<a name="FNanchor_DL_116" id="FNanchor_DL_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_DL_116" class="fnanchor">[DL]</a> At the same time, He
commissioned <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute; to collect the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>Writings He had revealed in the two castles, and hand them
for safe-keeping to Siyyid Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m-i-<span class="u">Kh</span>al&iacute;l, who resided in
Tabr&iacute;z.</p>

<p>When the B&aacute;b reached Ur&uacute;m&iacute;yyih, on his way to Tabr&iacute;z,
the Governor, Malik Q&aacute;sim M&iacute;rz&aacute;, a descendant of Fa&#7789;h-`Al&iacute;
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, received Him reverently. Nevertheless, he decided
to pose a test for his Guest. On a Friday, when the B&aacute;b
planned to go to the public bath, he directed that a particularly
unruly horse be brought to convey Him. Those who
knew of his plan awaited the outcome with bated breath.
Miraculously, the horse stood quietly for the B&aacute;b, who
mounted and rode it to the bath with perfect control. The
Prince-Governor, ashamed and abashed, walked on foot
beside the B&aacute;b's steed nearly to His destination, until the
B&aacute;b asked him to return to his house. The news spread and
stunned the town. When the B&aacute;b came out of the bath and
mounted the same horse again, men, women and children
rushed in to take away every drop of the water He had used.</p>

<p>From now on the Governor's residence was thronged daily
by people who wished to meet the B&aacute;b or just to catch a
glimpse of Him. During this time, &Aacute;q&aacute;-B&aacute;l&aacute; Big, the
Naqq&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>-B&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute; (Chief Painter) made a portrait of the B&aacute;b,
the only one ever drawn of Him; its story is of tremendous
interest.</p>

<p>&Aacute;q&aacute;-B&aacute;l&aacute; Big was a native of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;shv&aacute;n, a village on the
banks of Lake Ur&uacute;m&iacute;yyih. Like scores of others, he was
attracted to Government House to see the B&aacute;b. Years later
he related his experience to Varq&aacute;, the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; martyr-poet.
He had noticed that as soon as the B&aacute;b's eyes alighted on
him He arranged His `ab&aacute; neatly and looked at him intently.
This happened again the next day, and &Aacute;q&aacute;-B&aacute;l&aacute; Big
realized that the B&aacute;b was giving him a sign that he might
draw His portrait. The painter made a rough sketch there
and then. Later, he composed the portrait in black and
white. When Varq&aacute; informed Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h of this, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
instructed to ask the painter to make two copies of the
portrait in water colour, one to be sent to the Holy Land
and one to be kept by Varq&aacute; himself. The copy taken to the
Holy Land is in the International Archives of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;
Faith. The copy which the martyr-poet held was among his
possessions, looted at the time of his arrest. The original
black and white portrait was discovered years later by Siyyid
Asadu'll&aacute;h-i-Qum&iacute;, who conveyed it to the Holy Land and
presented it to `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;.<a name="FNanchor_DM_117" id="FNanchor_DM_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_DM_117" class="fnanchor">[DM]</a></p>

<p>The B&aacute;b must have reached Tabr&iacute;z in the last week of
July 1848. Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h's illness was, by then, giving
concern to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;, and the wily old Grand Vizier,
conscious of his approaching downfall, was already seeking
ways and means of softening the blow. Over the course of
years he had grown to be a very rich man, owning villages
and farmlands and urban property. He knew that with the
death of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h he would lose not only his
position and power, but also his enormous wealth. When
Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h was dying, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; was no
longer to be seen within the precincts of the palace, for his
powerful enemies in the Court, whom he had not been able
to destroy,<a name="FNanchor_DN_118" id="FNanchor_DN_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_DN_118" class="fnanchor">[DN]</a> were ready to pounce on him. He retired to
his village of `Abb&aacute;s&aacute;b&aacute;d. There his body-guard, recruited
from his home town of M&aacute;h-K&uacute;, disintegrated. The people of
&#7788;ihr&aacute;n who had suffered so much at their hands now found
opportunities to avenge themselves, and &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;
found himself in such straits that he felt constrained to write
to the boy-prince, `Abb&aacute;s M&iacute;rz&aacute;, and a number of prominent
courtiers, to plead for harmony and friendship. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
no response was forthcoming from these quarters, he put on
a bold face and tried to regain his residence in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. But
the artillery General, who commanded the royal guard at
the citadel, let him know that his stay in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n was undesirable.
So he tried to reach &Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>arb&aacute;yj&aacute;n, the province
to which he had exiled the B&aacute;b, to take refuge with the
inhabitants of his native town. He had not gone far from
the capital when he was turned back. Deserted and mocked,
he had no course open but to seek sanctuary in the shrine
of <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h `Abdu'l-`A&#7827;&iacute;m. Such was the end of all power for
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;, the Antichrist of the B&aacute;b&iacute; Revelation.</p>

<p>In Tabr&iacute;z the B&aacute;b was brought before the Crown Prince,
N&aacute;&#7779;iri'd-D&iacute;n M&iacute;rz&aacute;, who was only seventeen years old and
had recently been given the governorship of &Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>arb&aacute;yj&aacute;n.
A panel of the prominent divines of Tabr&iacute;z gathered to
examine the B&aacute;b. The leading men of that panel were: &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Ma&#7717;m&uacute;d, the Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu'l-`Ulam&aacute;, who was the chief
tutor of the Crown Prince; Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-i-M&aacute;maq&aacute;n&iacute;,
a disciple of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im and an outstanding figure among
the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute;s; &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Murti&#7693;&aacute;-Qul&iacute;y-i-Marand&iacute;, the `Alamu'l-Hud&aacute;;
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; `Al&iacute;-A&#7779;<span class="u">gh</span>ar, the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>u'l-Isl&aacute;m;<a name="FNanchor_DO_119" id="FNanchor_DO_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_DO_119" class="fnanchor">[DO]</a> and
M&iacute;rz&aacute; A&#7717;mad, the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih. The procedures of that
high tribunal were frivolous from beginning to end. Here
were the shining lights of the religious hierarchy of Tabr&iacute;z,
assembled to learn from a young Siyyid, who claimed to be
the bearer of a Message from God, what the nature of His
claim was and what proofs He could adduce to substantiate
it. That they failed miserably to be just and to apply themselves
to the problem before them need not be sought in the
evidence of the followers of the B&aacute;b. Two of the best known
Persian histories of the time plentifully provide that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
evidence. These are the <i>N&aacute;si<span class="u">kh</span>u't-Tav&aacute;r&iacute;<span class="u">kh</span></i> by Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute;
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n of K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n<a name="Nanchor_XI5"
id="Nanchor_XI5"></a><a href="#Note_XI5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and the Supplement to the <i>Raw&#7693;atu'&#7779;-&#7778;af&aacute;</i>
of M&iacute;r<span class="u">kh</span>und<a name="FNanchor_DP_120" id="FNanchor_DP_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_DP_120" class="fnanchor">[DP]</a> by Ri&#7693;&aacute;-Qul&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-Hid&aacute;yat; both
works were written during the reign of N&aacute;&#7779;iri'd-D&iacute;n <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h.
From these two histories, Edward Granville Browne
prepared a version of the proc&egrave;s-verbal of that infamous
tribunal for the Appendices to his translation of <i>A Traveller's
Narrative</i>. He also used another book, the <i>Qi&#7779;a&#7779;u'l-`Ulam&aacute;</i>
(Chronicles of the Divines) written in 1873. Typical are
these two questions, said to have been put to the B&aacute;b by
Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu'l-`Ulam&aacute;:</p>

<blockquote><p>'As the Prophet or some other wise man hath said
"Knowledge is twofold&mdash;knowledge of bodies, and
knowledge of religions"; I ask, then, in Medicine, what
occurs in the stomach when a person suffers from
indigestion? Why are some cases amenable to treatment?
And why do some go on to permanent dyspepsia or
syncope [swooning], or terminate in hypochondriasis?'</p>

<p>'The science of "Applications" is elucidated from the
Book and the Code, and the understanding of the Book
and the Code [the Qur'&aacute;n and the Traditions] depends
on many sciences, such as Grammar, Rhetoric, and Logic.
Do you who are the B&aacute;b conjugate <i>&#7730;&aacute;la</i>?'<a name="FNanchor_DQ_121" id="FNanchor_DQ_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_DQ_121" class="fnanchor">[DQ]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The B&aacute;b is alleged to have replied that He had learned to
conjugate Arabic words in His childhood, but had forgotten
the rules. This is supposed to have been the answer of a
Person who had revealed the <i>Qayy&uacute;mu'l-Asm&aacute;'</i>, the <i>Commentary
on the S&uacute;rih of Kaw<span class="u">th</span>ar</i>, the <i>Commentary on the S&uacute;rih
of V'al-`A&#7779;r</i>&mdash;all in Arabic.</p>

<p>When the B&aacute;b stated clearly: 'I am that person for whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
appearance ye have waited a thousand years,' Niz&aacute;mu'l-`Ulam&aacute;
retorted:</p>

<p>'That is to say you are the Mahd&iacute;, the Lord of Religion?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered the B&aacute;b.</p>

<p>'The same in person, or generically?'</p>

<p>'In person.'</p>

<p>'What is your name, and what are the names of your
father and mother? Where is your birthplace? And how
old are you?'</p>

<p>'My name is `Al&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad,' answered the B&aacute;b. 'My
mother was named Khad&iacute;ja and my father M&iacute;rz&aacute; Ri&#7827;&aacute; the
cloth-seller; my birth-place is Sh&iacute;r&aacute;z; and of my life,
behold, thirty-five years have elapsed.'<a name="FNanchor_DR_122" id="FNanchor_DR_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_DR_122" class="fnanchor">[DR]</a></p>

<p>'The name of the Lord of Religion is Mu&#7717;ammad; his
father was named &#7716;asan and his mother Narjis; his birthplace
was Surra-man-Ra'a; and his age is more than a
thousand years. There is the most complete variance. And
besides I did not send you.'</p>

<p>'Do you claim to be God?' asked the B&aacute;b.</p>

<p>'Such an Im&aacute;m is worthy of such a God,' replied Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu'l-`Ulam&aacute;.</p>

<p>'I can in one day write two thousand verses. Who else
can do this?'</p>

<p>'When I resided at the Supreme Shrines I had a secretary
who used to write two thousand verses a day. Eventually
he became blind. You must certainly give up this occupation,
or else you too will go blind.'<a name="Nanchor_XI6" id="Nanchor_XI6"></a><a
href="#Note_XI6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Even from these few quotations the absurdity of the trial
may be seen.</p>

<p>The authors of <i>N&aacute;si<span class="u">kh</span>u't-Tav&aacute;r&iacute;<span class="u">kh</span></i>, the Supplement to
<i>Raw&#7693;atu'&#7779;-&#7778;af&aacute; and Qi&#7779;a&#7779;u'l-`Ulam&aacute;</i> took their material from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
a tract written by the same Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu'l-`Ulam&aacute; who presided
over the tribunal in Tabr&iacute;z. But <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute;,
the son of Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-i-M&aacute;maq&aacute;n&iacute;, and no less an
opponent of the Faith of the B&aacute;b than his father, in a book
written specifically to refute that Faith, took Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu'l-`Ulam&aacute;
to task for having perverted the truth. <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>
Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute; was himself present at the tribunal; in
his book he underlined, one by one, Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu'l-`Ulam&aacute;'s
misrepresentations. His testimony to the powers of the B&aacute;b,
which he recorded despite his avowed, unrelenting antagonism,
has recently been reprinted. Eventually, Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu'l-`Ulam&aacute;
collected as many copies as he could of his own tract
and destroyed them.</p>

<p>Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am states, on the authority of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute;,
that the person most insolent in the course of
that mock trial was Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-i-M&aacute;maq&aacute;n&iacute;.<a name="FNanchor_DS_123" id="FNanchor_DS_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_DS_123" class="fnanchor">[DS]</a> The
B&aacute;b was sitting between him and the Crown Prince, and
when He affirmed that He was the Q&aacute;'im, whose advent
they expected, Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad called out in anger:</p>

<p>'You wretched and immature lad of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z! You have
already convulsed and subverted `Ir&aacute;q; do you now wish
to arouse a like turmoil in &Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>irb&aacute;yj&aacute;n?'</p>

<p>The B&aacute;b's answer to his outburst was only this: 'Your
Honour, I have not come hither of My own accord. I have
been summoned to this place.'</p>

<p>Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad, yet more haughty and disdainful,
shouted back: 'Hold your peace, you perverse and contemptible
follower of Satan!'</p>

<p>And the B&aacute;b replied serenely: 'Your Honour, I maintain
what I have already declared.'</p>

<p>Then, according to Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am, Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu'l-`Ulam&aacute; posed
this challenge:</p>

<p>'The claim which you have advanced is a stupendous one;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>it must needs be supported by the most incontrovertible
evidence.'</p>

<p>'His own word,' said the B&aacute;b, 'is the most convincing
evidence of the truth of the Mission of the Prophet of God.'
And He quoted from the Qur'&aacute;n a verse in support of His
argument: '"Is it not enough for them that We have sent
down to Thee the Book?"'<a name="FNanchor_DT_124" id="FNanchor_DT_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_DT_124" class="fnanchor">[DT]</a></p>

<p>Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu'l-`Ulam&aacute; rejoined: 'Describe orally, if you speak
the truth, the proceedings of this gathering in language that
will resemble the phraseology of the verses of the Qur'&aacute;n
so that the Val&iacute;-`Ahd [Crown Prince] and the assembled
divines may bear witness to the truth of your claim.'</p>

<p>The B&aacute;b had spoken no more than a few words in response
to this request when Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad rudely
intervened:</p>

<p>'This self-appointed Q&aacute;'im of ours has at the very start
of his address betrayed his ignorance of the most rudimentary
rules of grammar!'</p>

<p>'The Qur'&aacute;n itself does in no wise accord with the rules
and conventions current amongst men,' said the B&aacute;b. 'The
Word of God can never be subject to the limitations of His
creatures. Nay, the rules and canons which men have adopted
have been deduced from the text of the Word of God and
are based upon it. These men have, in the very texts of
that holy Book, discovered no less than three hundred
instances of grammatical error, such as the one you now
criticise. Inasmuch as it was the Word of God, they had
no other alternative except to resign themselves to His
will.'</p>

<p>But Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad turned a deaf ear to the B&aacute;b, and
another divine interrupted with an absurd question about
the tense of a verb. Then the B&aacute;b spoke this verse of the
Qur'&aacute;n: 'Far be the glory of thy Lord, the Lord of all greatness,
from what they impute to Him, and peace be upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>His Apostles!' And He rose up from His seat and walked
out.<a name="FNanchor_DU_125" id="FNanchor_DU_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_DU_125" class="fnanchor">[DU]</a><a name="Nanchor_XI7"
id="Nanchor_XI7"></a><a href="#Note_XI7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after these proceedings, it was decided to inflict
corporal punishment upon the B&aacute;b, and He was taken to the
house of Mu&#7717;ammad-K&aacute;&#7827;im <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the farr&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>-b&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;.<a name="FNanchor_DV_126" id="FNanchor_DV_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_DV_126" class="fnanchor">[DV]</a> As
the guards refused to carry out the sentence, M&iacute;rz&aacute; `Al&iacute;-A&#7779;<span class="u">gh</span>ar,
the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>u'l-Isl&aacute;m, personally administered the
bastinado. When the news reached Ur&uacute;m&iacute;yyih that the B&aacute;b
had been subjected to such indignity, many of those who
had been attracted to His Faith abandoned it. In Tabr&iacute;z,
the B&aacute;b was seen by Dr. Cormick, an English physician, the
only Westerner ever to have met Him. The Reverend Benjamin
Labaree, D.D., of the American Presbyterian Mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
at Ur&uacute;m&iacute;yyih, asked Dr. Cormick for the particulars of
his visit. The English physician wrote in answer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You ask me for some particulars of my interview with
the founder of the sect known as B&aacute;b&iacute;s. Nothing of any
importance transpired in this interview, as the B&aacute;b was
aware of my having been sent with two other Persian
doctors to see whether he was of sane mind or merely a
madman, to decide the question whether to put him to
death or not. With this knowledge he was loth to answer
any questions put to him. To all enquiries he merely
regarded us with a mild look, chanting in a low melodious
voice some hymns, I suppose. Two other <i>Sayyids</i>, his
intimate friends, were also present, who subsequently
were put to death with him,<a name="FNanchor_DW_127" id="FNanchor_DW_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_DW_127" class="fnanchor">[DW]</a> besides a couple of government
officials. He only once deigned to answer me, on my
saying that I was not a Musulm&aacute;n and was willing to know
something about his religion, as I might perhaps be
inclined to adopt it. He regarded me very intently on my
saying this, and replied that he had no doubt of all
Europeans coming over to his religion. Our report to
the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h at that time was of a nature to spare his life. He
was put to death some time after by the order of the
<i>Am&iacute;r-i-Ni&#7827;&aacute;m</i> M&iacute;rz&aacute; Taq&iacute; Kh&aacute;n. On our report he
merely got the bastinado, in which operation a <i>farr&aacute;sh</i>,
whether intentionally or not, struck him across the face
with the stick destined for his feet, which produced a
great wound and swelling of the face. On being asked
whether a Persian surgeon should be brought to treat
him, he expressed a desire that I should be sent for, and
I accordingly treated him for a few days, but in the
interviews consequent on this I could never get him to
have a confidential chat with me, as some Government
people were always present, he being a prisoner.</p>

<p>He was very thankful for my attentions to him. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>a very mild and delicate-looking man, rather small in
stature and very fair for a Persian, with a melodious soft
voice, which struck me much. Being a Sayyid, he was
dressed in the habits of that sect, as were also his two
companions. In fact his whole look and deportment went
far to dispose one in his favour. Of his doctrine I heard
nothing from his own lips, although the idea was that
there existed in his religion a certain approach to Christianity.
He was seen by some Armenian carpenters, who
were sent to make some repairs in his prison, reading the
Bible, and he took no pains to conceal it, but on the contrary
told them of it. Most assuredly the Musulm&aacute;n fanaticism
does not exist in his religion, as applied to Christians,
nor is there that restraint of females that now exists.<a name="Nanchor_XI8"
id="Nanchor_XI8"></a><a href="#Note_XI8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It must have been sometime in the first days of August
1848 that the B&aacute;b was restored to <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q. From there, He
addressed a letter to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;:</p>

<blockquote><p>O thou who hast disbelieved in God, and hast turned thy
face away from His signs!<a name="Nanchor_XI9" id="Nanchor_XI9"></a><a
href="#Note_XI9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That letter, stern and unsparing, is known as the <i><span class="u">Kh</span>u&#7789;biy-i-Qahr&iacute;yyih</i>
(Sermon of Wrath). The B&aacute;b sent it to &#7716;ujjat,
who was still in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n unable to return to his native town,
to give it in person to the Grand Vizier. Hujjat carried out
the task entrusted to him. By then &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; had
fallen from power, to end his days in obscurity in `Ir&aacute;q.</p>

<p>Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h died on September 4th 1848.<a name="FNanchor_DX_128" id="FNanchor_DX_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_DX_128" class="fnanchor">[DX]</a> Less
than a year later, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; followed him to the grave.</p>

<p>The death of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h and the downfall of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; were events of far-reaching consequence. The
new monarch was very young and inexperienced, while the
man who now occupied the seat left vacant by the disappearance
of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute; was capable and uncorrupted,
but self-willed and headstrong. M&iacute;rz&aacute; Taq&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n,
the Am&iacute;r-Ni&#7827;&aacute;m (better known by his later title Am&iacute;r-i-Kab&iacute;r)
had by sheer force of his abilities raised himself from
humble origins to a position of power. His father had been
a cook in the employment of the illustrious Q&aacute;'im-Maq&aacute;m.
And it had been that great minister who had first noticed
high promise in the young Taq&iacute;. Although N&aacute;&#7779;iri'd-D&iacute;n
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h now reigned over &Iacute;r&aacute;n, it was M&iacute;rz&aacute; Taq&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n who
ruled it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once again, within the confines of <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q, the B&aacute;b had
uninterrupted communication with His followers. Mull&aacute;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
&Aacute;d&iacute; Guzal, a native of Mar&aacute;<span class="u">gh</span>ih (&Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>-rb&aacute;yj&aacute;n), acted as a
courier, often traversing vast distances on foot. Decades
later `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; recalled a day when this indefatigable
man arrived at &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, dressed as a dervish and much travel-stained.
Va&#7717;&iacute;d, on learning who he was and from whence he
had come, bent low and kissed the mud-encrusted feet
of the courier, for he had been in the presence of the
Beloved.</p>

<p>One of this courier's journeys took him to Qudd&uacute;s, with
the gift of a valuable pen-case and a silk turban sent by the
B&aacute;b. And when Qudd&uacute;s and Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn and their companions
died as martyrs in M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n, the B&aacute;b chose this
same faithful courier to go on pilgrimage in His stead to the
land drenched with their blood. Thus Mull&aacute; &Aacute;d&iacute; Guzal
was the first B&aacute;b&iacute; to set eyes on the scenes of that carnage.
He was also, for two months, the B&aacute;b's personal attendant
in the castle of <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q.<a name="Nanchor_XII1"
id="Nanchor_XII1"></a><a href="#Note_XII1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Sulaym&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the son of Ya&#7717;y&aacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n of Tabr&iacute;z, was
one of the prominent followers of the B&aacute;b who attained His
presence in this castle, after making the journey in disguise.<a name="FNanchor_DY_129" id="FNanchor_DY_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_DY_129" class="fnanchor">[DY]</a>
He had no liking for service at court, and had gone to
`Ir&aacute;q, to live under the shadow of the Shrine of Im&aacute;m
&#7716;usayn. There he found himself attracted to the teachings
of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im and, hearing later of the advent of the B&aacute;b,
gave Him his allegiance. The news of the plight of his
fellow-believers, who were hounded and besieged in M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n,
drew him back to his native land. He reached &#7788;ihr&aacute;n
dressed as a cleric. M&iacute;rz&aacute; Taq&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, however, made him
discard his turban and long cloak, and forced him to wear
a military uniform. But he could not prevail upon him to
enter the service of the Government. Sulaym&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n's
primary purpose remained unfulfilled: to give aid to Qudd&uacute;s
and the B&aacute;bu'l-B&aacute;b proved impossible, but his sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
departure from Karbil&aacute; was not to be in vain, or barren of
significant result.</p>

<p>Another visitor to <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q during the closing months of
the life of the B&aacute;b was His uncle, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;.
His life too was nearing its end, to be laid down in the path
of his Nephew. Two years had passed since the day his
Nephew bade him farewell in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, and &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid
`Al&iacute; could no longer bear the pangs of separation. He settled
his accounts, closed his books and took the road to &Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>arb&aacute;yj&aacute;n.
Having attained his heart's desire, he wrote to his
brother, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad, to help him see
the truth of their Nephew's mission. His letter was written
on the fifth day of Jam&aacute;d&iacute;u'l-&Uacute;l&aacute;&mdash;the anniversary of the
Declaration of the B&aacute;b. 'On such a day,' he told his brother,
'the resplendent Light of God shone forth.... This is the
day of Resurrection ... the day to behold the Visage of
God.'<a name="Nanchor_XII2" id="Nanchor_XII2"></a><a href="#Note_XII2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The One promised, expected and awaited had indeed
come, he asserted, and come with verses constituting the
primal proof of all the Manifestations of God. He desired
all the members of his family to see his letter. One cannot but
marvel at the quality of devotion and certainty that this
letter reveals.</p>

<p>To meet, after such a long interval, the uncle who had
stood <i>in loco parentis</i> to Him when He was orphaned, must
have given the B&aacute;b intense joy. But within a few months<a name="FNanchor_DZ_130" id="FNanchor_DZ_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_DZ_130" class="fnanchor">[DZ]</a>
of His uncle's visit, news came that brought Him unbearable
sorrow. At <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7788;abars&iacute; in M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n a large number of
His followers had been massacred, including nine of His
first disciples, the Letters of the Living; amongst them
were the B&aacute;bu'l-B&aacute;b who had first believed in Him, and
Qudd&uacute;s, His companion on the journey to &#7716;ij&aacute;z, the beloved
disciple whose primacy was unquestioned.</p>

<p>According to His amanuensis:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>The B&aacute;b was heart-broken at the receipt of this unexpected
intelligence. He was crushed with grief, a grief
that stilled His voice and silenced His pen. For nine days
He refused to meet any of His friends. I myself, though
His close and constant attendant, was refused admittance.
Whatever meat or drink we offered Him, He was disinclined
to touch. Tears rained continually from His eyes,
and expressions of anguish dropped unceasingly from
His lips. I could hear Him, from behind the curtain,
give vent to His feelings of sadness as He communed, in
the privacy of His cell, with His Beloved. I attempted to
jot down the effusions of His sorrow as they poured
forth from His wounded heart. Suspecting that I was
attempting to preserve the lamentations He uttered, He
bade me destroy whatever I had recorded. Nothing remains
of the moans and cries with which that heavy-laden
heart sought to relieve itself of the pangs that had
seized it. For a period of five months He languished,
immersed in an ocean of despondency and sorrow.<a name="Nanchor_XII3"
id="Nanchor_XII3"></a><a href="#Note_XII3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Conscious that His own life was fast approaching its end,
the B&aacute;b put all His Writings, His pen-case, His seals and
rings in a box which He entrusted to Mull&aacute; B&aacute;qir-i-Tabr&iacute;z&iacute;,
one of the Letters of the Living, with instructions to deliver
it, together with a letter, to M&iacute;rz&aacute; A&#7717;mad-i-K&aacute;tib (Mull&aacute;
`Abdu'l-Kar&iacute;m-i-Qazv&iacute;n&iacute;). Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mull&aacute; B&aacute;qir departed forthwith for Qazv&iacute;n. Within
eighteen days he reached that town and was informed
that M&iacute;rz&aacute; A&#7717;mad had departed for Qum. He left
immediately for that destination and arrived towards the
middle of the month of <span class="u">Sh</span>a`b&aacute;n.<a name="FNanchor_EA_131" id="FNanchor_EA_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_EA_131" class="fnanchor">[EA]</a> I was then in Qum....
I was living in the same house with M&iacute;rz&aacute; A&#7717;mad.... In
those days <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `A&#7827;&iacute;m, Siyyid Ism&aacute;`&iacute;l, and a number
of other companions likewise were dwelling with us.
Mull&aacute; B&aacute;qir delivered the trust into the hands of M&iacute;rz&aacute;
A&#7717;mad, who, at the insistence of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `A&#7827;&iacute;m, opened it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>before us. We marvelled when we beheld, among the
things which that coffer contained, a scroll of blue paper,
of the most delicate texture, on which the B&aacute;b, in His own
exquisite handwriting, which was a fine <span class="u">sh</span>ikastih script,
had penned, in the form of a pentacle, what numbered
about five hundred verses, all consisting of derivatives
from the word 'Bah&aacute;'.<a name="FNanchor_EB_132" id="FNanchor_EB_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_EB_132" class="fnanchor">[EB]</a> That scroll was in a state of perfect
preservation, was spotlessly clean.... So fine and
intricate was the penmanship that, viewed at a distance,
the writing appeared as a single wash of ink on the paper.
We were overcome with admiration as we gazed upon a
masterpiece which no calligraphist, we believed, could
rival. That scroll was replaced in the coffer and handed
back to M&iacute;rz&aacute; A&#7717;mad, who, on the very day he received
it, proceeded to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. Ere he departed, he informed us
that all he could divulge of that letter was the injunction
that the trust was to be delivered into the hands of Jin&aacute;b-i-Bah&aacute;<a name="FNanchor_EC_133" id="FNanchor_EC_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_EC_133" class="fnanchor">[EC]</a>
in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n.<a name="Nanchor_XII4" id="Nanchor_XII4"></a><a
href="#Note_XII4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was also during the last few months of His life that the
B&aacute;b composed the Arabic <i>Bay&aacute;n</i>, which, in the estimation of
Nicolas, is the epitome of the teachings of the B&aacute;b.</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p>The man who took the decision to have the B&aacute;b executed
was M&iacute;rz&aacute; Taq&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the Grand Vizier of N&aacute;&#7779;iri'd-D&iacute;n <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h.
His obdurate nature brooked no opposition. M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-N&uacute;r&iacute;, who had a ministerial post, made a faint protest,
but his voice went unheeded. Orders were sent to
&#7716;amzih M&iacute;rz&aacute;, the &#7716;i<span class="u">sh</span>matu'd-Dawlih, Governor-General
of &Aacute;<span class="u">dh</span>arb&aacute;yj&aacute;n, to bring the B&aacute;b to Tabr&iacute;z. When these were
carried out further orders came from the Grand Vizier,
brought by no less a person than his brother, M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;asan
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the Vaz&iacute;r Niz&aacute;m. They were to the effect that the B&aacute;b
should be executed by a firing squad, in full public view.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>&#7716;i<span class="u">sh</span>matu'd-Dawlih refused absolutely to be associated in
any way with such a dastardly action. His response was: 'I am
neither Ibn-i-Z&iacute;y&aacute;d nor Ibn-i-Sa`d<a name="FNanchor_ED_134" id="FNanchor_ED_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_ED_134" class="fnanchor">[ED]</a> that he should call upon
me to slay an innocent descendant of the Prophet of God.'<a name="Nanchor_XII5"
id="Nanchor_XII5"></a><a href="#Note_XII5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The Grand Vizier, on being informed by M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;asan
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n of this refusal, instructed his brother to carry out the
orders under his own authority. Divested of His turban and
sash which indicated His lineage, the B&aacute;b and His attendants
were taken on foot to the barracks, from the house
which the Governor had put at their disposal. On the way to
the citadel, a youth, barefoot and dishevelled, threw himself
at the feet of the B&aacute;b, beseeching Him: 'Send me not
from Thee, O Master. Wherever Thou goest, suffer me to
follow Thee.' To this the B&aacute;b replied: 'Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;,
arise, and rest assured that you will be with Me. Tomorrow
you shall witness what God has decreed.'<a name="Nanchor_XII6"
id="Nanchor_XII6"></a><a href="#Note_XII6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>This youth, M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;y-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute;, had long
been devoted to the B&aacute;b, but his stepfather<a name="FNanchor_EE_135" id="FNanchor_EE_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_EE_135" class="fnanchor">[EE]</a> had used every
subterfuge to prevent him from meeting the B&aacute;b and voicing
his allegiance, even going to the length of locking him up
in his own house. <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute; was related to the
family, and thus had access to M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;.
Visiting him one day, <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan found the youth transformed,
no longer wretched and bemoaning his fate, but
happy and at peace. 'The eyes of my Beloved,' he told
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7716;asan, 'have beheld this face, and these eyes have
gazed upon His countenance.' He then recounted an
experience he had had:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Let me tell you the secret of my happiness. After the B&aacute;b
had been taken back to <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q,<a name="FNanchor_EF_136" id="FNanchor_EF_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_EF_136" class="fnanchor">[EF]</a> one day, as I lay confined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>in my cell, I turned my heart to Him and besought Him in
these words: 'Thou beholdest, O my Best-Beloved, my
captivity and helplessness, and knowest how eagerly I
yearn to look upon Thy face. Dispel the gloom that
oppresses my heart, with the light of Thy countenance.'
What tears of agonising pain I shed that hour! I was so
overcome with emotion that I seemed to have lost
consciousness. Suddenly I heard the voice of the B&aacute;b, and,
lo! He was calling me. He bade me arise. I beheld the
majesty of His countenance as He appeared before me.
He smiled as He looked into my eyes. I rushed forward
and flung myself at His feet. 'Rejoice,' He said; 'the hour
is approaching when, in this very city, I shall be suspended
before the eyes of the multitude and shall fall a victim
to the fire of the enemy. I shall choose no one except you
to share with Me the cup of martyrdom. Rest assured that
this promise which I give you shall be fulfilled.'<a name="Nanchor_XII7"
id="Nanchor_XII7"></a><a href="#Note_XII7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, two years later, in a thoroughfare of Tabr&iacute;z, M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;y-i-Zun&uacute;z&iacute; received the same promise and
assurance from the B&aacute;b.</p>

<p>That night the B&aacute;b was joyous. He knew that on the
following day He would quaff the cup of martyrdom. He
also knew that His Mission on this earth was totally accomplished,
despite fierce opposition mounted by the divines
and rulers of the land, and despite the tyrannies and indignities
to which He had been mercilessly subjected. No
power had succeeded in quenching the flame of faith which
His Word had set ablaze. He had knowingly sacrificed His
life for the sake of the Redeemer promised unto all Faiths.
The near advent of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'
(Man-Yu&#7827;hiruhu'll&aacute;h) had been His constant theme. He
had made the acceptance of His own Book&mdash;the mighty
<i>Bay&aacute;n</i>&mdash;dependent upon the good pleasure of 'Him Whom
God shall make manifest', Whom He had addressed in the
early days of His Ministry:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>O Thou Remnant of God! I have sacrificed myself wholly
for Thee; I have accepted curses for Thy sake, and have
yearned for naught but martyrdom in the path of Thy
love.<a name="Nanchor_XII8" id="Nanchor_XII8"></a><a
href="#Note_XII8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And now on this night&mdash;His last on earth&mdash;He was happy
and contented. He told the faithful disciples who were with
Him that He preferred to meet His death at the hand of a
friend rather than at the hands of enemies, and invited them
to fulfil His wish. Among those men who so dearly loved
Him, only M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute; dared to undertake that
fearsome task, but his companions restrained him. 'This
same youth who has risen to comply with My wish,' the
B&aacute;b said, 'will, together with Me, suffer martyrdom. Him
will I choose to share with Me its crown.' And He added:
'Verily Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute; will be with Us in Paradise.'<a
name="Nanchor_XII9" id="Nanchor_XII9"></a><a href="#Note_XII9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Jesus was crucified with two criminals, and St. Luke tells
us:</p>

<blockquote><p>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed
on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>

<p>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not
thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p>

<p>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward
of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>

<p>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou
comest into thy kingdom.</p>

<p>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day
shalt thou be with me in paradise.<a name="FNanchor_EG_137" id="FNanchor_EG_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_EG_137" class="fnanchor">[EG]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the morning they took the B&aacute;b to the homes of the
leading divines: Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-i-M&aacute;maq&aacute;n&iacute;, Mull&aacute;
Murti&#7693;&aacute;-Qul&iacute;y-i-Marand&iacute; and M&iacute;rz&aacute; B&aacute;qir, to obtain the
death-warrants. These men needed no inducement: they
had the warrants written, signed and sealed, ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
deliver to the farr&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>-b&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;, and did not even deign to
show their faces to the Prisoner.</p>

<p>Again we are reminded of St. Luke:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote
<i>him</i>.</p>

<p>And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him
on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it
that smote thee?</p>

<p>And many other things blasphemously spake they
against him.</p>

<p>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and
the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led
him into their council, saying,</p>

<p>Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If
I tell you, ye will not believe:</p>

<p>And if I also ask <i>you</i>, ye will not answer me, nor let
<i>me</i> go.</p>

<p>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of
the power of God.</p>

<p>Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God?
And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</p>

<p>And they said, What need we any further witness? for
we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.<a name="FNanchor_EH_138" id="FNanchor_EH_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_EH_138" class="fnanchor">[EH]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The stepfather of M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute; now made an
attempt to save him. Siyyid &#7716;usayn-i-Yazd&iacute; and his brother,
at the instructions of the B&aacute;b Himself, had recanted so that
they could take to the followers of the B&aacute;b His last words
and wishes. M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute; refused all blandishments,
declared his desire to die with his Master, and told
Mull&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-i-M&aacute;maq&aacute;n&iacute; to his face: 'I am not mad.
Such a charge should rather be brought against you who
have sentenced to death a man no less holy than the promised
Q&aacute;'im. He is not a fool who has embraced His Faith
and is longing to shed his blood in His path.'<a name="Nanchor_XII10"
id="Nanchor_XII10"></a><a href="#Note_XII10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> His
young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
child was brought to him. They thought that, perchance,
the sight of the boy might soften his heart. But M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;'s resolve remained unshaken. God would
provide for his child and protect him.</p>

<p>So at noon they led the B&aacute;b and His disciple to the square
in front of the citadel of Tabr&iacute;z. S&aacute;m <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the commander
of the Armenian regiment detailed to execute them, was ill
at ease. The Prisoner looked kind and compassionate. For
what crime was He to be put to death? Unable to still the
voice of his conscience, S&aacute;m <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n approached the B&aacute;b:
'I profess the Christian Faith and entertain no ill will against
you. If your Cause be the Cause of Truth, enable me to free
myself from the obligation to shed your blood.' To this
the B&aacute;b replied: 'Follow your instructions, and if your
intention be sincere, the Almighty is surely able to relieve
you from your perplexity.'<a name="Nanchor_XII11" id="Nanchor_XII11"></a><a
href="#Note_XII11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The B&aacute;b and His disciple were suspended by ropes from
a nail in the wall, the head of M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;
resting on the breast of the B&aacute;b. Seven hundred and fifty
soldiers were positioned in three files. Roofs of the buildings
around teemed with spectators.</p>

<p>Each row of soldiers fired in turn. The smoke from so
many rifles clouded the scene. When it lifted the B&aacute;b was
not there. Only His disciple could be seen, standing under
the nail in the wall, smiling and unconcerned. Bullets had
only severed the ropes with which they were suspended.
Cries rang out from the onlookers: 'The Siyyid-i-B&aacute;b has
gone from our sight!'</p>

<p>A frantic search followed. The B&aacute;b was found, sitting
in the same room where He had been lodged the night before,
in conversation with His amanuensis. That conversation had
been interrupted earlier in the day. Now it was finished and
He told the farr&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>-b&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute; to carry out his duty. But the
farr&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>-b&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute; was terror-stricken and ran away, nor did he
ever return to his post. S&aacute;m <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, for his part, told his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
superiors that he had carried out the task given to him; he
would not attempt it a second time. So &Aacute;q&aacute; J&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-<span class="u">Kh</span>amsih
and his N&aacute;&#7779;ir&iacute; regiment replaced the Armenians,
and the B&aacute;b and His disciple were suspended once again
at the same spot.</p>

<p>Now the B&aacute;b addressed the multitude gathered to see Him
die:</p>

<blockquote><p>Had you believed in Me, O wayward generation, every
one of you would have followed the example of this youth,
who stood in rank above most of you, and willingly
would have sacrificed himself in My path. The day will
come when you will have recognised Me; that day I shall
have ceased to be with you.<a name="Nanchor_XII12" id="Nanchor_XII12"></a><a
href="#Note_XII12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And St. Luke relates:</p>

<blockquote><p>And there followed him a great company of people,
and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>

<p>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem,
weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for
your children.</p>

<p>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they
shall say, Blessed <i>are</i> the barren, and the wombs that
never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</p>

<p>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on
us; and to the hills, Cover us.<a name="FNanchor_EI_139" id="FNanchor_EI_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_EI_139" class="fnanchor">[EI]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The N&aacute;&#7779;ir&iacute; regiment fired. The bodies of the B&aacute;b and His
disciple were shattered, and their flesh was united. But the
face of the B&aacute;b was untouched. Then a storm descended
upon Tabr&iacute;z. Tempestuous winds blew and dust darkened
the skies, and the skies remained dark, until the darkness of
the day merged into the darkness of the night.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness
over all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple
was rent in the midst.</p>

<p>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said,
Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having
said thus, he gave up the ghost.<a name="FNanchor_EJ_140" id="FNanchor_EJ_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_EJ_140" class="fnanchor">[EJ]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus at noon, one midsummer day&mdash;Sunday July 9th
1850<a name="FNanchor_EK_141" id="FNanchor_EK_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_EK_141" class="fnanchor">[EK]</a>&mdash;they put to death a Manifestation of God, just as at
noon, centuries before, another Manifestation of God was
slain.</p>

<p>When night fell, they dragged the bodies through the
streets of Tabr&iacute;z, and threw them on the edge of the moat
surrounding the city. Soldiers were stationed there to guard
over them, lest the B&aacute;b&iacute;s attempt to retrieve the precious
remains. Not far away, two B&aacute;b&iacute;s, feigning madness, kept
vigil throughout the night.</p>

<p>Next morning the Russian Consul took an artist with him
to make a drawing of the remains of the B&aacute;b.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sulaym&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, that loyal disciple who attained the
presence of the B&aacute;b in <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q, reached Tabr&iacute;z the day after
His martyrdom. He had intended to rescue his Master. But
that was not to be. Now, he went straightway to &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mihd&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the Kal&aacute;ntar (Mayor) of Tabr&iacute;z, who
was a friend of long standing, and told him that he had
decided to dare everything that very night and carry the
bodies away by a surprise attack on the soldiers guarding
them on the edge of the moat. The Kal&aacute;ntar told Sulaym&aacute;n
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n to withdraw for the moment and assured him that
there was a much safer and more reliable way to achieve
his purpose.</p>

<p>There was in Tabr&iacute;z a certain &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; All&aacute;h-Y&aacute;r, a confidant
of the Kal&aacute;ntar, well-known for his exploits. Instructed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the Kal&aacute;ntar, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; All&aacute;h-Y&aacute;r used such means as he knew
best to take the bodies away from under the eyes of the
soldiers. He delivered the remains to Sulaym&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, who
had them moved to the silk factory of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; A&#7717;mad, a B&aacute;b&iacute;
of M&iacute;l&aacute;n. There they were enshrouded and hidden under the
bales of silk. Next day a casket was made to contain them,
and they were sent away to safety. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; All&aacute;h-Y&aacute;r refused to
accept any reward for his service.<a name="Nanchor_XII13"
id="Nanchor_XII13"></a><a href="#Note_XII13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Soldiers reported the disappearance of the bodies. Wild
beasts had devoured the remains, they alleged, while they
slept. And the divines gave credence to that story and
shouted for joy. What better proof could there be to show
how false the Siyyid-i-B&aacute;b was? Beasts do not, cannot
consume the remains of the Im&aacute;m.<a name="FNanchor_EL_142" id="FNanchor_EL_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_EL_142" class="fnanchor">[EL]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 13<br />
THE DAWN-BREAKERS</h2>

<span class="i0">Knowest thou what the seekers of life should seek?<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>The B&aacute;b appeared in a country renowned for a glorious
and envied past; but since the beginning of the nineteenth
century &Iacute;r&aacute;n had declined rapidly. The structure of the State
had begun to falter under the &#7778;afavid dynasty (1501-1732),
enjoying only a brief revival in the next two reigns.<a name="FNanchor_EM_143" id="FNanchor_EM_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_EM_143" class="fnanchor">[EM]</a> But by
the middle of the nineteenth century, Persia was materially
impoverished, intellectually stagnant, spiritually moribund.
The condition of the peasantry was appalling. Corruption
had eaten deep into the vitals of the nation and oppression
and tyranny were widespread. It is said that every man has
his price; the adage was particularly true of the Persians of
the mid-nineteenth century. Offices of State and governorships
were shamelessly bought and sold. Taxes and customs
revenues were farmed. Bribery, peculation and extortion
were legitimized under the respectable name of Mad&aacute;<span class="u">kh</span>il
(Perquisites). Historic cities and buildings were falling
into ruin. Many a traveller has remarked on the magnificent
aspect of famous cities, towns and villages when seen from
afar, with their domes and minarets, citadels and gateways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
groves and orchards; but how miserable and dilapidated
they were found to be when one entered them. The toll of
disease and neglect and insecurity had reduced the population
of a country with an area the size of Western Europe
to well below ten million.</p>

<p>The burden of a semi-feudal state was indeed onerous,
and no less so was the burden of the dominance established
by the divines. Certainly, they had in their ranks men of the
calibre and quality of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad-i-A&#7717;s&aacute;'&iacute;, Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad-B&aacute;qir-i-Ra<span class="u">sh</span>t&iacute;<a name="FNanchor_EN_144" id="FNanchor_EN_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_EN_144" class="fnanchor">[EN]</a>
and <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Murti&#7693;&aacute;y-i-An&#7779;&aacute;r&iacute;, men who had high regard
for truth and righteousness; just as there were in the service
of the State men of enlightened vision and shining integrity.
But collectively the divines abused the power they had
obtained with the advent of the &#7778;afavid dynasty.</p>

<p>The fall of a nation from the pinnacle of achievement is
more marked than the decline from lesser heights.</p>


<h3>The Call to a New Day</h3>

<p>The Call of the B&aacute;b was a call to awakening, a claim that
a New Day had dawned. But the magnitude of this claim
was not easily realized; one of the first to do so was Qurratu'l-`Ayn.
When Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;y-i-Bas&#7789;&aacute;m&iacute; was condemned and
imprisoned in Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d, she was still at Karbil&aacute;. Because
of complaints by the <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah divines, the Government sent
her back to Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d, where she lodged in the house of
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>ibl, the father of &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad
Mu&#7779;&#7789;af&aacute;y-i-Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d&iacute;, until the Government moved her to
the house of the Muft&iacute; of Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d.<a name="FNanchor_EO_145" id="FNanchor_EO_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_EO_145" class="fnanchor">[EO]</a> So outspoken was she in
her public statements that some of her fellow-believers from
K&aacute;&#7827;imayn were alarmed and, according to &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Mu&#7779;&#7789;af&aacute;,
agitated against her. Siyyid `Al&iacute; Bi<span class="u">sh</span>r, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
most learned of them, wrote a letter on their behalf to the
B&aacute;b, which Nawr&uacute;z-`Al&iacute;, once an attendant of Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im, took to Him in M&aacute;h-K&uacute;, returning with His answer
which rang with high praise of Qurratu'l-`Ayn. It caused
Siyyid `Al&iacute; Bi<span class="u">sh</span>r and his party from K&aacute;&#7827;imayn<a name="FNanchor_EP_146" id="FNanchor_EP_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_EP_146" class="fnanchor">[EP]</a> to withdraw
from the Faith they had previously espoused with enthusiasm.
The B&aacute;b described Qurratu'l-`Ayn, in that Epistle,
as &#7788;&aacute;hirih, the Pure, and &#7778;idd&iacute;qih, the Truthful, and laid an
injunction on His followers in `Ir&aacute;q to accept without question
whatever she might pronounce, for they were not in a
position to understand and appreciate her station. By this
time a large number of B&aacute;b&iacute;s had assembled in Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d,
and Qurratu'l-`Ayn was constantly and openly teaching the
Faith. She had received a copy of the <i>Commentary on the
S&uacute;rih of Kaw<span class="u">th</span>ar</i>, which the B&aacute;b had revealed for Va&#7717;&iacute;d,
and she made full use of it, driving the opposing divines to
desperation. When she threw down a challenge to them to
debate the issue with her, their only reply was vehement
denunciation.</p>

<p>Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; was still at his post as V&aacute;l&iacute; of Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d, but
he was now a chastened man. Moreover, the opponents of
Qurratu'l-`Ayn were the <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah divines and Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;,
being a Sunn&iacute;, would take no action to please them, but
he reported to the Sublime Porte that Qurratu'l-`Ayn had
challenged them. The authorities in Constantinople were
also not prepared to give comfort to <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ahs by making a
martyr of Qurratu'l-`Ayn. At the same time they had no
wish to champion her cause. They told Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; that,
as Qurratu'l-`Ayn was Persian, she should confine her
challenge to the divines of her native land; she should be
sent to Persia.<a name="FNanchor_EQ_147" id="FNanchor_EQ_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_EQ_147" class="fnanchor">[EQ]</a> So Qurratu'l-`Ayn (or &#7788;&aacute;hirih as we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
call her), accompanied by a number of ardent and prominent
B&aacute;b&iacute;s,<a name="Nanchor_XIII1" id="Nanchor_XIII1"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> quitted Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d and was escorted to the frontier
by Mu&#7717;ammad &Aacute;q&aacute; Y&aacute;var, an officer in the service of Naj&iacute;b
P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;, who became attracted to the Cause she was advocating.</p>

<p>Various eventful stops were made by &#7788;&aacute;hirih and her
companions in their journey across Persia to Qazv&iacute;n. In the
small town of Kirand, her eloquence and the clarity of her
disquisition so impressed the chiefs of that area that they
offered to place twelve thousand men under her command, to
follow her wherever she went. The great majority (if not
all) of the inhabitants of Kirand and its neighbourhood were
`Al&iacute;yu'll&aacute;h&iacute;s. &#7788;&aacute;hirih gave them her blessing, told them to
keep to their homes, and moved on to Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h. The
challenge she presented to &Aacute;q&aacute; `Abdu'll&aacute;h-i-Bihbih&aacute;n&iacute;, the
leading divine of that town, thoroughly discomfited him.
With the populace clamouring for a positive answer, and
the Governor treating &#7788;&aacute;hirih with great respect, the cornered
divine sought to free himself from his dilemma by
writing to her father in Qazv&iacute;n, asking him to send some of
his close relatives to remove her from Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h. &Aacute;q&aacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-Mu&#7779;&#7789;af&aacute;, himself an eye-witness, vividly describes
how four men came from Qazv&iacute;n, joined forces with
a Qazv&iacute;n&iacute; officer stationed in Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h, invaded the
house where &#7788;&aacute;hirih's companions resided, and beat and
robbed them of all they possessed. When the Governor
learned what had happened, he ordered the arrest of the
culprits and restored to the B&aacute;b&iacute;s their property. It was soon
known that &Aacute;q&aacute; `Abdu'll&aacute;h had conspired to bring about
this situation.</p>

<p>From Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h, &#7788;&aacute;hirih and her companions moved
on to fresh scenes of triumph in the small town of &#7778;a&#7717;nih,
before reaching Hamad&aacute;n. Here her brothers arrived from
Qazv&iacute;n to beg her to return with them to their native place.
She agreed on condition that she should stay in Hamad&aacute;n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
long enough to make the public cognizant of the Faith of
the B&aacute;b. During her days in Hamad&aacute;n, she issued a challenge
to Ra'&iacute;su'l-`Ulam&aacute;, the leading divine of the city, whose
response was to have the bearer of her treatise, Mull&aacute;
Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m-i-Ma&#7717;all&aacute;t&iacute;, himself a distinguished divine, beaten
and thrown out of his house. Mull&aacute; Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m lingered between
life and death for some days, and although he recovered, his
martyrdom was not far off. This reverse was outweighed by
&#7788;&aacute;hirih's success in converting two ladies of the Royal
Family, married to scions of the aristocracy of Hamad&aacute;n,
and even more significant were her talks with two of the
most learned Jewish rabbis,<a name="FNanchor_ER_148" id="FNanchor_ER_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_ER_148" class="fnanchor">[ER]</a> which led to attracting members
of the Jewish Faith to the B&aacute;b&iacute; fold.<a name="FNanchor_ES_149" id="FNanchor_ES_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_ES_149" class="fnanchor">[ES]</a> Hamad&aacute;n, flourishing
on the site of ancient Ecbatana, is the city where the tombs
of Esther and Mordecai are situated.</p>

<p>As promised, &#7788;&aacute;hirih then left for Qazv&iacute;n in the company
of her brothers. Before departing, she asked most of the
Arab B&aacute;b&iacute;s, who were with her, to return to `Ir&aacute;q. Only a
few stayed behind, to join her later in Qazv&iacute;n, but within a
month she requested all of her fellow-believers, Arab and
Persian alike, who had travelled with her, to leave her native
town. Of the large company who had come from `Ir&aacute;q,
attending and supporting her, only Mull&aacute; Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m-i-Ma&#7717;all&aacute;t&iacute;
and <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;-al-Kar&iacute;m&iacute; remained with her in
Qazv&iacute;n.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<p>Three of the others<a name="FNanchor_ET_150" id="FNanchor_ET_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_ET_150" class="fnanchor">[ET]</a> went on to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, where they met
the B&aacute;bu'l-B&aacute;b. In April 1890, Edward Granville Browne,
returning from `Akk&aacute;, met one of them, &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Mu&#7779;&#7789;af&aacute;,
in Beirut and inquired about that meeting and the
appearance of Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn. He learned that the B&aacute;bu'l-B&aacute;b
was</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lean and fragile to look at, but keen and bright as the
sword which never left his side.<a name="FNanchor_EU_151" id="FNanchor_EU_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_EU_151" class="fnanchor">[EU]</a> For the rest, he was not
more than thirty or thirty-five years old, and his raiment
was white.<a name="Nanchor_XIII2" id="Nanchor_XIII2"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At Qazv&iacute;n, &#7788;&aacute;hirih refused to be reunited with her husband
and went to her father's house. Her impetuous uncle,
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mull&aacute; Taq&iacute;, felt greatly insulted and his wrath knew no
bounds. His denunciation of those whom he considered to
be responsible for his daughter-in-law's waywardness became
fiercer than ever before. <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad and Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im
were the particular targets of his vilification. Then, one
morning at dawn, he was found in the mosque, fatally
stabbed. Immediately the B&aacute;b&iacute;s were accused of his murder,
and even &#7788;&aacute;hirih was considered guilty, was kept under
close watch, and her life was in danger. Although a <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z&iacute;<a
name="Nanchor_XIII3" id="Nanchor_XIII3"></a><a href="#Note_XIII3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
confessed that he had slain &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mull&aacute; Taq&iacute; because of his
rabid animosity towards <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad and Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im,
three B&aacute;b&iacute;s, totally innocent of the crime, were put to death&mdash;<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>
&#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;-al-Kar&iacute;m&iacute; in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, and Mull&aacute; Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m-i-Ma&#7717;allat&iacute;
and Mull&aacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir in Qazv&iacute;n. These three were the
first martyrs of the B&aacute;b&iacute; Faith in Persia itself, and their
deaths constituted the first public execution of B&aacute;b&iacute;s.<a name="FNanchor_EV_152" id="FNanchor_EV_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_EV_152" class="fnanchor">[EV]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Asadu'll&aacute;h, a well-known merchant of the Farh&aacute;d&iacute;
family, was also martyred, while in prison, by partisans
of &#7788;&aacute;hirih's husband, the Im&aacute;m-Jum`ih of Qazv&iacute;n, and a
report was circulated that he had died from natural causes.</p>

<p>&#7788;&aacute;hirih was now totally isolated. Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h gave the
task of rescuing her to M&iacute;rz&aacute; H&aacute;d&iacute;, the nephew of the martyred
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Asadu'll&aacute;h. This young man, who had left
Qazv&iacute;n at the outset of agitation against the B&aacute;b&iacute;s, returned
at the risk of his life and successfully carried out his mission.
&#7788;&aacute;hirih reached &#7788;ihr&aacute;n in safety. Thus it was that she could
be at the conference of Bada<span class="u">sh</span>t, where she rendered her
most signal service to the Faith of the B&aacute;b.</p>


<h3>The Conference of Bada<span class="u">sh</span>t</h3>

<p>The gathering of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s at Bada<span class="u">sh</span>t coincided with the
removal of the B&aacute;b, from the castle of <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q to Tabr&iacute;z,
for His public examination. Contrary to certain allegations,
the B&aacute;b&iacute;s did not congregate in Bada<span class="u">sh</span>t to concert plans to
rescue Him. They came there, guided by Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, to
settle a vital and cardinal issue: was this persuasion of theirs
just an offshoot of Isl&aacute;m, or was it an independent Faith?
Until then no public claim had been made that the B&aacute;b,
as the Q&aacute;'im of the House of Mu&#7717;ammad, was an Inaugurator
of a new theophany. Strange it seems, in perspective,
that about the time when a decision was being reached in
a tiny hamlet on the edge of <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n, hundreds of miles
away in the city of Tabr&iacute;z, the B&aacute;b was announcing His
station before a tribunal summoned to question Him.<a name="FNanchor_EW_153" id="FNanchor_EW_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_EW_153" class="fnanchor">[EW]</a></p>

<p>`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; states that Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h and Qudd&uacute;s had
agreed that the time had come to declare the advent of a new
Dispensation.<a name="Nanchor_XIII4" id="Nanchor_XIII4"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> However, there were faint hearts in the B&aacute;b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>&iacute;
ranks, as events were to prove. &#7788;&aacute;hirih had met opposition
from fellow-B&aacute;b&iacute;s because she had always been bold enough
to assert that this was indeed a new day. Any announcement
at Bada<span class="u">sh</span>t would have to be emphatic and unhedged, to
make a persuasive impact. And this it was, in a most dramatic
way.</p>

<p>Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h had rented three gardens in Bada<span class="u">sh</span>t: Qudd&uacute;s
lived in one, &#7788;&aacute;hirih in the second, and Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h had a
tent pitched in the third. Other B&aacute;b&iacute;s, among whom were a
number of the Letters of the Living such as M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;,
the brother-in-law of &#7788;&aacute;hirih, and Mull&aacute; B&aacute;qir-i-Tabr&iacute;z&iacute;,
lived under tents in the grounds facing the three
gardens.<a name="FNanchor_EX_154" id="FNanchor_EX_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_EX_154" class="fnanchor">[EX]</a></p>

<p>During the three weeks of the conference, argument and
counter-argument were put forward, and differences of view
and approach arose between Qudd&uacute;s and &#7788;&aacute;hirih. At last
it was &#7788;&aacute;hirih's unheard-of gesture, courageous beyond
belief and description, followed by Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h's decisive
intervention, which made clear to all that a new Dispensation
had begun. &#7788;&aacute;hirih's brave act was to cast aside her veil.
Men were shaken to the depths of their being to see her
thus. Some fled with horror from the scene. One, in
desperation, tried to cut his throat. When the uproar subsided,
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h called for a copy of the Qur'&aacute;n and
directed a reciter to read the fifty-sixth s&uacute;rih, 'al-W&aacute;qi`a':<a name="FNanchor_EY_155" id="FNanchor_EY_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_EY_155" class="fnanchor">[EY]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>When the inevitable day of judgment shall suddenly
come, no soul shall charge the prediction of its coming
with falsehood: it will abase some, and exalt others. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>the earth shall be shaken with a violent shock; and the
mountains shall be dashed in pieces, and shall become as
dust scattered abroad; and ye shall be separated into three
distinct classes: the companions of the right hand (how
happy shall the companions of the right hand be!), and
the companions of the left hand (how miserable shall the
companions of the left hand be!), and those who have
preceded others in the faith shall precede them to paradise.
These are they who shall approach near unto God: they
shall dwell in gardens of delight.</p></blockquote>

<p>At Bada<span class="u">sh</span>t the faint-hearted fell away. And when those
who had remained steadfast left the hamlet it was to go out
into a world, for them, greatly changed. That change was in
a sense a reflection of the transformation they had experienced.
They were determined to assert their freedom
from the fetters of the past. In a country tightly wedded to
blind, rigid orthodoxy, the deportment of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s would
arouse bitter hostility. There were B&aacute;b&iacute;s, undoubtedly, who
in their newly-found consciousness of emancipation, committed
repellent excesses, and they deserved rejection by
their fellow-countrymen. But for the majority, the animosity
now directed against them created a situation which was new,
and in turn required counter-measures to ensure their very
existence. The opposition they had met in the past was
sporadic, and not nation-wide, depending on the character,
influence and power of the leaders, directors and instigators
of such opposition, in any particular locality. The open
welcome which the Bab had received when He reached I&#7779;fah&aacute;n,
following the barbaric treatment He had suffered at
the hands of the Governor-General and the divines of F&aacute;rs;
the enthusiasm and eagerness with which the people had, at
first, greeted Him both in Tabr&iacute;z and Ur&uacute;m&iacute;yyih; the friendly
reception which Qudd&uacute;s had found in Kirm&aacute;n, after being
humiliated in <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z; the reverence shown conspicuously
to &#7788;&aacute;hirih in Kirand and Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h; the respect and kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
attention accorded to the B&aacute;bu'l-B&aacute;b by &#7716;amzih M&iacute;rz&aacute;, the
Governor-General of <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_EZ_156" id="FNanchor_EZ_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_EZ_156" class="fnanchor">[EZ]</a>&mdash;all were to become only
memories, sadly lacking counterparts in the era whose
opening was marked by the B&aacute;b's public declaration of His
station as the promised Q&aacute;'im during His examination at
Tabr&iacute;z, the echoing affirmation of the dawning of a new and
independent religious Dispensation at the conference of
Bada<span class="u">sh</span>t, and by the death of Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h.</p>

<p>Hardly had the conference of Bada<span class="u">sh</span>t ended when the
people of the village of N&iacute;y&aacute;l&aacute; attacked the B&aacute;b&iacute;s. Nab&iacute;l-i-A`&#7827;am
heard the story from Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h Himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We were all gathered in the village of N&iacute;y&aacute;l&aacute; and were
resting at the foot of a mountain, when, at the hour of
dawn, we were suddenly awakened by the stones which
the people of the neighbourhood were hurling upon us
from the top of the mountain. The fierceness of their attack
induced our companions to flee in terror and consternation.
I clothed Qudd&uacute;s in my own garments and despatched
him to a place of safety, where I intended to
join him. When I arrived, I found that he had gone.
None of our companions had remained in N&iacute;y&aacute;l&aacute; except
&#7788;&aacute;hirih and a young man from <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, M&iacute;rz&aacute; `Abdu'll&aacute;h.
The violence with which we were assailed had brought
desolation into our camp. I found no one into whose
custody I could deliver &#7788;&aacute;hirih except that young man,
who displayed on that occasion a courage and determination
that were truly surprising. Sword in hand, undaunted
by the savage assault of the inhabitants of the village, who
had rushed to plunder our property, he sprang forward
to stay the hand of the assailants. Though himself
wounded in several parts of his body, he risked his life
to protect our property. I bade him desist from his act.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>When the tumult had subsided, I approached a number
of the inhabitants of the village and was able to convince
them of the cruelty and shamefulness of their behaviour.
I subsequently succeeded in restoring a part of our plundered
property.<a name="Nanchor_XIII5" id="Nanchor_XIII5"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>


<h3>The Episode of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7788;abars&iacute;</h3>

<p>It was mid-July 1848 when the B&aacute;b&iacute;s were scattered by
the assault of the villagers of N&iacute;y&aacute;l&aacute;. They took different
routes, but many of them came together again. Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h
travelled to N&uacute;r, His home in M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n. Qudd&uacute;s was
arrested and taken to the town of S&aacute;r&iacute;, also in M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n,
where he was lodged, under restraint, in the home of M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute;, the leading divine. &#7788;&aacute;hirih also went to
the same province, and she too was arrested. Later, she was
sent to the capital and was given into the charge of Ma&#7717;m&uacute;d
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the Kal&aacute;ntar (Mayor) of &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, who detained her
until the hour of her martyrdom in August 1852.</p>

<p>Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, whose visit to the camp of &#7716;amzih M&iacute;rz&aacute;
had prevented him from attending the conference of
Bada<span class="u">sh</span>t, had in the meantime returned to Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had, and
intended to go to Karbil&aacute;. But an emissary of the B&aacute;b
overtook him with an urgent message. The B&aacute;b had conferred
on him the name of Siyyid `Al&iacute;, had sent him a green
turban of His own to wear, and had instructed him to go to
the aid of Qudd&uacute;s with the Black Standard unfurled before
him&mdash;the Standard of which the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad had
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Should your eyes behold the Black Standards proceeding
from <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n, hasten ye towards them, even though ye
should have to crawl over the snow, inasmuch as they
proclaim the advent of the promised Mihd&iacute;, the Vicegerent
of God.<a name="Nanchor_XIII6" id="Nanchor_XIII6"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn began his long march to M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n to
rescue Qudd&uacute;s, accompanied by many of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
scattered after the incident in N&iacute;y&aacute;l&aacute;, and some of the newly-converted
who ranged themselves behind the Black Standard.
Their numbers, on that journey, swelled into hundreds.
On their way they raised the call of the New Day, finding
eager supporters, but also such venomous hostility that they
could not take residence in any town or village. Yet they
did not intend to engage in combat with anyone, let alone
the forces of the State. They were only demonstrating their
belief and their vision.</p>

<p>As they approached B&aacute;rfur&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>, its leading divine, Sa`&iacute;du'l-`Ulam&aacute;,
was so vituperative in denouncing Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn
that the whole town rose up to oppose the B&aacute;b&iacute;s. Clashes
and casualties were inevitable. Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn himself, in
the fray, cut through the trunk of a tree and the barrel of a
gun, in one stroke of his sword, to fell an adversary.<a name="FNanchor_FA_157" id="FNanchor_FA_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_FA_157" class="fnanchor">[FA]</a> The
people of B&aacute;rfur&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span> were worsted and asked for a truce, and
because of their unrest, their leaders begged Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn
to leave on the morrow for &Aacute;mul. `Abb&aacute;s-Qul&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-L&aacute;r&iacute;j&aacute;n&iacute;,
whom Nicolas names as 'the chief military personage
of the province,'<a name="Nanchor_XIII7" id="Nanchor_XIII7"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> gave Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn a solemn
promise, fortified by an oath on the Qur'&aacute;n, that <span class="u">Kh</span>usraw-i-Q&aacute;d&iacute;-Kal&aacute;'&iacute;
and his horsemen would escort the B&aacute;b&iacute;s to
safety through the forests. This military chief impressed
on <span class="u">Kh</span>usraw the need to do his duty by Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn, and
to show him respect and consideration. But Sa`&iacute;du'l-`Ulam&aacute;
corrupted <span class="u">Kh</span>usraw by telling him that he personally would
accept responsibility before God and man for any injury,
or even death, that might be inflicted on the B&aacute;b&iacute;s. Once in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the depths of the forest, <span class="u">Kh</span>usraw and his hundred men
treacherously attacked the B&aacute;b&iacute;s. He received his desert
at the hands of a man<a name="FNanchor_FB_158" id="FNanchor_FB_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_FB_158" class="fnanchor">[FB]</a> of learning, not a hardened trooper,
who at the first opportunity stabbed and killed <span class="u">Kh</span>usraw
with a dagger.</p>

<p>The Grand Vizier was particularly irked and infuriated
that the B&aacute;b&iacute;s could defeat and put to flight his force,
although, for the most part, they were untrained in the arts
of war. True, one could find in their ranks men such as
Ri&#7693;&aacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-Turkam&aacute;n,<a name="FNanchor_FC_159" id="FNanchor_FC_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_FC_159" class="fnanchor">[FC]</a> an accomplished young courtier,
whose father was the Master of the Horse in the royal
establishment. But these were exceptions. The vast majority
were artisans, small traders, merchants, students of theology,
divines.</p>

<p><span class="u">Kh</span>usraw's treachery and death, and raids by hostile
villagers on the exposed flanks of the B&aacute;b&iacute; camp, forced
Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn to seek a place where the B&aacute;b&iacute;s could be
safely lodged. Arriving on October 12th 1848 at the shrine
of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> A&#7717;mad ibn-i-Ab&iacute;-&#7788;&aacute;lib-i-&#7788;abars&iacute;, about fourteen
miles south-east of B&aacute;rfur&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>, he gave orders for the construction
of a fortress round the shrine, under the supervision
of the builder of the B&aacute;b&iacute;yyih in Ma<span class="u">sh</span>had (see p. <a href="#Page_56">56</a>).
They were harassed at every stage by neighbouring villagers
and had often to defend themselves. No sooner was their
work finished than they received a visit from Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h,
who advised Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn to seek the release of Qudd&uacute;s,
that he might be with them. This mission was soon accomplished
and, towards the end of that year, Qudd&uacute;s joined
them in the newly-built fortress, to be acknowledged by
Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn as above him in rank.</p>

<p>On January 30th 1849, Lt.-Col. Farrant, then charg&eacute;
d'affaires in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, reported to Lord Palmerston that some
five hundred persons, 'disciples of a Fanatic, who calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
himself the door, or gate of the true Mahomedan Religion',
had assembled in M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n, that fighting had broken
out, and that `Abb&aacute;s-Qul&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n-i-L&aacute;r&iacute;j&aacute;n&iacute; had been ordered
to proceed to that province and arrest the leaders.<a name="Nanchor_XIII9"
id="Nanchor_XIII9"></a><a href="#Note_XIII9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The B&aacute;b&iacute;s would gladly have lived peacefully within the
four walls they had erected around the shrine of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>
&#7788;abars&iacute;. But the continuous clamouring of the divines, led
by Sa`&iacute;du'l-`Ulam&aacute; of B&aacute;rfur&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>, and the despotic, obstinate
and haughty nature of the Grand Vizier, combined to deny
them peace and security. One army after another was sent
to reduce them. In sorties from their fortress they inflicted
heavy losses on the besieging forces, causing commanders
to flee for their lives. Some of the commanders<a name="FNanchor_FD_160" id="FNanchor_FD_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_FD_160" class="fnanchor">[FD]</a> died on the
battlefield, while Qudd&uacute;s, during one of the sorties, received
a bullet wound in his mouth.</p>

<p>Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, accompanied by His brother M&iacute;rz&aacute; Ya&#7717;y&aacute;,
with &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; J&aacute;n&iacute; of K&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;n, and Mull&aacute; B&aacute;qir of Tabr&iacute;z
(one of the Letters of the Living), set out from &#7788;ihr&aacute;n
to join the defenders of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7788;abars&iacute;, but they were
intercepted and taken to &Aacute;mul. Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h offered to
bear the punishment intended for the others, and was
bastinadoed.</p>

<p>At dawn of February 2nd 1849, Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn led his last
sortie. `Abb&aacute;s-Qul&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, in joint command of the Government
forces, had climbed a tree and, picking out the figure
of Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn on horseback, shot him in the chest. He
did not know whom he had mortally wounded, until a
timorous siyyid from Qum<a name="FNanchor_FE_161" id="FNanchor_FE_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_FE_161" class="fnanchor">[FE]</a> turned traitor and informed
him. Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn was carried by his companions to the
fort, where he died and was buried inside the shrine. He
was thirty-five years old. Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h wrote of him in the
<i>Kit&aacute;b-i-&Iacute;q&aacute;n&mdash;The Book of Certitude</i>:&mdash;'But for him, God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
would not have been established upon the seat of His
mercy, nor ascended the throne of eternal glory.'<a name="Nanchor_XIII10"
id="Nanchor_XIII10"></a><a href="#Note_XIII10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Now M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-B&aacute;qir-i-Q&aacute;'in&iacute; replaced Mull&aacute;
&#7716;usayn in leading the companions. But the end could not
be far off. Of the three hundred and thirteen defenders of
the fortress, a number had died, many were wounded, and
a few wavered in their resolve. The pressure of the forces
arrayed against them increased. Cannon were levelled at
them. Food became scarce and they ate grass, leaves of trees,
the skin and ground bone of their slaughtered horses, the
boiled leather of their saddles. `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; speaks of their
sufferings in the <i>Memorials of the Faithful</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For eighteen days they remained without food. They lived
on the leather of their shoes. This too was soon consumed,
and they had nothing left but water. They drank a mouthful
every morning, and lay famished and exhausted in
their fort. When attacked, however, they would instantly
spring to their feet, and manifest in the face of the enemy
a magnificent courage and astonishing resistance....
Under such circumstances to maintain an unwavering
faith and patience is extremely difficult, and to endure
such dire afflictions a rare phenomenon.<a name="Nanchor_XIII11" id="Nanchor_XIII11"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The end came not through abject surrender, but through
the perfidy of the foe. Prince Mihd&iacute;-Qul&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;, brother of
Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, took a solemn oath on the Qur'&aacute;n that
their lives and property would be inviolate should they come
out of the fortress and disperse in peace. A horse was sent
for Qudd&uacute;s to take him to the camp of the Prince. But once
the companions had been lured out of the fortress, the oath
was conveniently forgotten. The B&aacute;b&iacute;s were massacred, the
fortress was pillaged and razed to the ground. Hideous outrages
were committed upon the corpses of the slain, and a
vast area of the forest was strewn with their remains:
disembowelled, hacked to pieces, burned. Survivors were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
few. No more than three or four were kept to be heavily
ransomed. A few who were left for dead recovered. Still a
few others were sold into slavery and eventually found their
way back to the company of their fellow-believers. All the
dead were Persians except two Arabs of Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d who had
come out with &#7788;&aacute;hirih from `Ir&aacute;q.<a name="Nanchor_XIII12"
id="Nanchor_XIII12"></a><a href="#Note_XIII12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Qudd&uacute;s was taken to B&aacute;rfur&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>, his native town, where
Sa`&iacute;du'l-`Ulam&aacute;, his pitiless foe, awaited him. Prince Mihd&iacute;-Qul&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute;, oblivious to his pledge, forsook Qudd&uacute;s and
gave him into the hands of that bloodthirsty priest.
Imprecations were heaped upon the head of the captive.
He was made to suffer refined tortures and searing
agonies which an insanely jealous adversary had devised
for him. At the height of his torments he was heard to
say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Forgive, O my God, the trespasses of this people. Deal
with them in Thy mercy, for they know not what we
already have discovered and cherish.<a name="Nanchor_XIII13" id="Nanchor_XIII13"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the public square of B&aacute;rfur&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span> (the Sabzih-Mayd&aacute;n),
Sa`&iacute;du'l-`Ulam&aacute; struck Qudd&uacute;s down with an axe, and any
instrument which a frenzied mob could lay its hands on was
used to tear his flesh and dismember him. Then they threw
his shattered, mutilated body onto a blazing fire lit in the
square. That night, when all were gone, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;y-i-&#7716;amzih,
a divine, humane and compassionate,
universally acclaimed for his integrity, collected from the
dying embers what remained of the body of the martyr,
and reverently buried it.</p>

<p>The martyrdom of Qudd&uacute;s took place in the month of
May 1849, seven months after his fellow-B&aacute;b&iacute;s had first
taken refuge in the fort of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7788;abars&iacute;.<a name="Nanchor_XIII14"
id="Nanchor_XIII14"></a><a href="#Note_XIII14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It marked the
end of an episode which had begun, eleven months before,
with the raising of the Black Standard on the plain of <span class="u">Kh</span>ur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>&aacute;s&aacute;n; during
which deeds of incredible heroism by some
three hundred B&aacute;b&iacute;s had stunned and humiliated opposition
forces vastly outnumbering them; which had witnessed the
deaths of half the Letters of the Living, including the first,
the B&aacute;bu'l-B&aacute;b, and Qudd&uacute;s, the last and greatest; and which
closed with acts of treachery and atrocious cruelty. Words
which Qudd&uacute;s spoke during their occupation of the fort
are a fitting commentary upon the spirit of those who
defended it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Never ... have we under any circumstances attempted to
direct any offensive against our opponents. Not until
they unchained their attack upon us did we arise to defend
our lives. Had we cherished the ambition of waging holy
war against them, had we harboured the least intention of
achieving ascendancy through the power of our arms
over the unbelievers, we should not, until this day, have remained
besieged within these walls. The force of our arms
would have by now, as was the case with the companions
of Mu&#7717;ammad in days past, convulsed the nations of the
earth and prepared them for the acceptance of our Message.
Such is not our way, however, which we have
chosen to tread. Ever since we repaired to this fort, our
sole, our unalterable purpose has been the vindication,
by our deeds and by our readiness to shed our blood in
the path of our Faith, of the exalted character of our
mission. The hour is fast approaching when we shall be
able to consummate this task.<a name="Nanchor_XIII15" id="Nanchor_XIII15"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></blockquote>


<h3>The Year 1850</h3>

<p>While Qudd&uacute;s and his companions were defending themselves
at <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7788;abars&iacute;, B&aacute;b&iacute;s in other parts of Persia
were increasingly the victims of an intense and systematic
persecution on the part of both civil and ecclesiastical
authorities. The reason was not far to seek and was stated
by Sheil, once more at his post in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n after a long period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of absence, when he addressed Lord Palmerston on February
12th 1850:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... unluckily the proselytes are all of the Mahommedan
faith, which is inflexible in the punishment of a
relapsed Mussulman. Thus both the temporal and religious
authorities have an interest in the extermination
of this sect.</p>

<p>It is conjectured that in Teheran this religion has
acquired votaries in every class, not even excluding the
artillery and regular Infantry&mdash;Their numbers in this
city, it is supposed, may amount to about two thousand.<a name="Nanchor_XIII16"
id="Nanchor_XIII16"></a><a href="#Note_XIII16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Sheil's dispatches took note of four occurrences in
particular, in the year 1850: the execution of the B&aacute;b,<a name="FNanchor_FF_162" id="FNanchor_FF_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_FF_162" class="fnanchor">[FF]</a> the
episodes of Nayr&iacute;z and Zanj&aacute;n, and the public martyrdom
of seven B&aacute;b&iacute;s in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n.</p>


<h3>The Episode of Nayr&iacute;z</h3>

<p>The incomparable Va&#7717;&iacute;d&mdash;Siyyid Ya&#7717;y&aacute;y-i-D&aacute;r&aacute;b&iacute;&mdash;the
trusted emissary whom Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h had sent to investigate
the claims of the B&aacute;b and who had returned His
devoted supporter&mdash;was in Yazd in the early weeks of 1850,
fearlessly proclaiming the advent of the Q&aacute;'im in the person
of the B&aacute;b. Unwise acts by a purported fellow-believer put
his life in danger in that city, and he was forced to leave
secretly for Nayr&iacute;z in the province of F&aacute;rs.<a name="FNanchor_FG_163" id="FNanchor_FG_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_FG_163" class="fnanchor">[FG]</a> On hearing of
his approach, the people of his native quarter of <span class="u">Ch</span>in&aacute;r
S&uacute;<span class="u">kh</span>tih who loved and honoured Va&#7717;&iacute;d, together with a
number of the notables of Nayr&iacute;z, went out to meet him,
thus bringing on their families threats of dire punishment
by the Governor of Nayr&iacute;z, Zaynu'l-`&Aacute;bid&iacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, who
was fearful and desired to prevent Va&#7717;&iacute;d's entry to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
town.<a name="Nanchor_XIII17" id="Nanchor_XIII17"></a><a href="#Note_XIII17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But these warnings went unheeded; Va&#7717;&iacute;d continued
his journey and on arrival at his native quarter,
went straight to the Masjid-i-Jum`ih where, ascending the
pulpit, he addressed a congregation estimated to have
numbered fifteen hundred. He said:</p>

<blockquote><p>My sole purpose in coming to Nayr&iacute;z is to proclaim the
Cause of God. I thank and glorify Him for having enabled
me to touch your hearts with His Message. No need for
me to tarry any longer in your midst, for if I prolong my
stay, I fear that the governor will ill-treat you because of
me. He may seek reinforcement from <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z and destroy
your homes and subject you to untold indignities.<a name="Nanchor_XIII18"
id="Nanchor_XIII18"></a><a href="#Note_XIII18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But the people refused to let him go, for they were willing
and prepared, they assured him, to meet any misfortune
and hardship that might overtake them.</p>

<p>Zaynu'l-`&Aacute;bid&iacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, thwarted in his efforts to prevent
Va&#7717;&iacute;d's entrance into Nayr&iacute;z, and aroused to fury by the
influence he was exerting on the populace, schemed to entrap
and arrest him. For this purpose he recruited a thousand
trained soldiers. Some of those who had joined Va&#7717;&iacute;d
now broke away and forsook him, thus adding to the
strength of his opponents. The menace posed by the Governor
became so severe that Va&#7717;&iacute;d could find no way to secure
the safety of his people and himself, other than by taking
refuge with seventy-two of his companions in the fort of
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;jih outside Nayr&iacute;z. The Governor sent his brother,
`Al&iacute;-A&#7779;<span class="u">gh</span>ar <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, to attack this small band with the force
he had gathered. They did not succeed, but his brother was
killed in the engagement. The B&aacute;b&iacute;s now lived under
conditions of siege, and their water supply was cut off. They
built a water-cistern, strengthened their fort, and were
reinforced by additional residents of Nayr&iacute;z. Meanwhile,
appeals were being made by Zaynu'l-`&Aacute;bid&iacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n for
assistance from <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, until the Governor-General of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
F&aacute;rs, Prince F&iacute;r&uacute;z M&iacute;rz&aacute; (the Nu&#7779;ratu'd-Dawlih), who had
ordered the extermination of the besieged B&aacute;b&iacute;s, sent an
army to conclude the affair.<a name="Nanchor_XIII19" id="Nanchor_XIII19"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Even this large force could
not overcome the resistance of the defenders of the fortress.
Not only did victory elude it, but heavy losses were suffered.<a name="FNanchor_FH_164" id="FNanchor_FH_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_FH_164" class="fnanchor">[FH]</a></p>

<p>What had happened at <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7788;abars&iacute; was now reenacted
in Nayr&iacute;z. Zaynu'l-`&Aacute;bid&iacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n and his associates
resorted to fraud to overcome the B&aacute;b&iacute;s. They suspended
their attack and sent a written message to Va&#7717;&iacute;d, which
said, in effect:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hitherto, as we were ignorant of the true character of
your Faith, we have allowed the mischief-makers to
induce us to believe that every one of you has violated
the sacred precepts of Isl&aacute;m. Therefore did we arise
against you, and have endeavoured to extirpate your
Faith. During the last few days, we have been made
aware of the fact that your activities are untinged by any
political motive, that none of you cherish any inclination
to subvert the foundations of the State. We also have been
convinced of the fact that your teachings do not involve
any grave departure from the fundamental teachings of
Isl&aacute;m. All that you seem to uphold is the claim that a man
has appeared whose words are inspired and whose testimony
is certain, and whom all the followers of Isl&aacute;m
must recognise and support. We can in no wise be convinced
of the validity of this claim unless you consent to
repose the utmost confidence in our sincerity, and accept
our request to allow certain of your representatives to
emerge from the fort and meet us in this camp, where we
can, within the space of a few days, ascertain the character
of your belief. If you prove yourselves able to demonstrate
the true claims of your Faith, we too will readily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>embrace it, for we are not the enemies of Truth, and none
of us wish to deny it. Your leader we have always recognised
as one of the ablest champions of Isl&aacute;m, and we
regard him as our example and guide. This Qur'&aacute;n, to
which we affix our seals, is the witness to the integrity of
our purpose. Let that holy Book decide whether the claim
you advance is true or false. The malediction of God and
His Prophet rest upon us if we should attempt to deceive
you. Your acceptance of our invitation will save a whole
army from destruction, whilst your refusal will leave them
in suspense and doubt. We pledge our word that as soon
as we are convinced of the truth of your Message, we shall
strive to display the same zeal and devotion you already
have so strikingly manifested. Your friends will be our
friends, and your enemies our enemies. Whatever your
leader may choose to command, the same we pledge
ourselves to obey. On the other hand, if we fail to be
convinced of the truth of your claim, we solemnly promise
that we shall in no wise interfere with your safe
return to the fort, and shall be willing to resume our
contest against you. We entreat you to refuse to shed more
blood before attempting to establish the truth of your
Cause.<a name="Nanchor_XIII20" id="Nanchor_XIII20"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Va&#7717;&iacute;d was well aware of the dishonesty of this message;
nevertheless, he walked out in person, with five attendants,
into the camp of his enemies, where he was received
for three days with great ceremony. But all the while they
were planning a stratagem to overcome the occupants of
the fort. Under duress, they compelled Va&#7717;&iacute;d to write a
letter to his people, assuring them that a settlement had been
reached, and that they should abandon the fortress and return
to their homes. Va&#7717;&iacute;d attempted to caution his companions
against this treachery in a second letter which was never
delivered to them. Thus, within a month, did the defenders
of the fort of <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;jih meet the same fate as the defenders of
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7788;abars&iacute;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>Four years later, a divine of Nayr&iacute;z,<a name="FNanchor_FI_165" id="FNanchor_FI_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_FI_165" class="fnanchor">[FI]</a> a man who was just
and truthful and courageous, wrote the whole story of that
episode high on an inner wall of the Masjid-i-Jum`ih in the
B&aacute;z&aacute;r quarter. Although he had to write with circumspection
to avoid being denounced, he composed his narrative
in such a way that one can, without difficulty, read more of it
between the lines. His account bears out the fact that Va&#7717;&iacute;d
was given solemn assurances, that he was received with great
esteem and reverence, that those who had pledged their
word broke their pledges, that the quarter of <span class="u">Ch</span>in&aacute;r-S&uacute;<span class="u">kh</span>tih,
which was then a stronghold of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s of Nayr&iacute;z,<a name="FNanchor_FJ_166" id="FNanchor_FJ_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_FJ_166" class="fnanchor">[FJ]</a>
and the quarter of the B&aacute;z&aacute;r were sacked, that houses
were demolished, huge sums of money extorted, and Nayr&iacute;z
was reduced to a state of desolation.</p>

<p>The circumstances of Va&#7717;&iacute;d's martyrdom recall the
tragedy of Karbil&aacute;. All alone, he was assailed in the streets
of Nayr&iacute;z, as Im&aacute;m &#7716;usayn, whose descendant he was, had
been assailed on the Euphrates plain. There the body of the
Im&aacute;m had been trampled into the dust by the hooves of
horses, and in Nayr&iacute;z the corpse of Va&#7717;&iacute;d suffered similar
indignities. When the victorious army marched back to
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, it took as prisoners women and children, with the
heads of the martyrs of Nayr&iacute;z raised aloft on lances. Damascus
had witnessed a similar scene centuries before, when the
family of the martyred &#7716;usayn, which included his only
surviving son, was paraded in its streets, to be led into the
court of the tyrant Yaz&iacute;d, preceded by the head of the Im&aacute;m
and those of his sons and brothers and nephews&mdash;the flower
of the House of Mu&#7717;ammad.</p>


<h3>The Seven Martyrs of &#7788;ihr&aacute;n</h3>

<p>At the beginning of 1850, seven B&aacute;b&iacute;s were arrested in
&#7788;ihr&aacute;n, charged with plotting to assassinate the Grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>Vizier. They are known as the Seven Martyrs of &#7788;ihr&aacute;n.
The accusation was palpably false. There were many B&aacute;b&iacute;s
in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n better equipped to engage in such an exercise.
But more significant, all seven were men of outstanding
character and repute, and respected by their countrymen.
The real reason for their arrest was their espousal of the
Faith of the B&aacute;b. Although efforts were made by men high
in the professions they represented, to persuade them to give
lip-denial to their most sacred beliefs, they steadfastly
refused and were beheaded.</p>

<p>The Guardian of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith has vividly described
this terrible scene, which was enacted in a public square
of &#7788;ihr&aacute;n (the Sabzih-Mayd&aacute;n):</p>

<blockquote><p>The defiant answers which they flung at their persecutors;
the ecstatic joy which seized them as they drew near the
scene of their death; the jubilant shouts they raised as they
faced their executioner; the poignancy of the verses which,
in their last moments, some of them recited; the appeals
and challenges they addressed to the multitude of onlookers
who gazed with stupefaction upon them; the
eagerness with which the last three victims strove to
precede one another in sealing their faith with their blood;
and lastly, the atrocities which a bloodthirsty foe degraded
itself by inflicting upon their dead bodies which lay
unburied for three days and three nights in the Sabzih-Mayd&aacute;n,
during which time thousands of so-called devout
<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ahs kicked their corpses, spat upon their faces, pelted,
cursed, derided, and heaped refuse upon them&mdash;these
were the chief features of the tragedy of the Seven Martyrs
of &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, a tragedy which stands out as one of the
grimmest scenes witnessed in the course of the early unfoldment
of the Faith of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h.<a name="Nanchor_XIII21" id="Nanchor_XIII21"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;, the uncle of the B&aacute;b, was one of
these martyrs. He had recently returned from his visit to the
B&aacute;b in <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q (see p. <a href="#Page_150">150</a>) and could easily have left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
capital, when rumours were rife following the events of
M&aacute;zindar&aacute;n and Yazd. But he fearlessly stayed on, spurned
all efforts made to induce him to recant, and met death gladly
in the path of his Nephew.</p>

<p>The other six were: M&iacute;rz&aacute; Qurb&aacute;n-`Al&iacute; of B&aacute;rfur&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>,
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mull&aacute; Ism&aacute;`&iacute;l-i-Qum&iacute;, Siyyid &#7716;usayn-i-Tur<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;z&iacute;, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute;y-i-Kirm&aacute;n&iacute;, Siyyid Murta&#7693;&aacute;y-i-Zanj&aacute;n&iacute;
and &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-&#7716;usayn-i-Mar&aacute;<span class="u">gh</span>i'&iacute;.</p>

<p>M&iacute;rz&aacute; Qurb&aacute;n-`Al&iacute; had been a Ni`matu'll&aacute;h&iacute; dervish, and
a leading figure of that mystic order. He was well-known in
the ruling circles of the capital and greatly respected. M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Taq&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n (the Grand Vizier) particularly wished to save
him, but the faith of the dervish remained unshakable. At
his execution, the first blow of the executioner's sword
only knocked his turban off his head, whereupon he recited
aloud:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Happy he whom love's intoxication<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hath overcome that scarce he knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether at the feet of the Beloved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It be head or turban which he throws!<a name="Nanchor_XIII22"
id="Nanchor_XIII22"></a><a href="#Note_XIII22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mull&aacute; Ism&aacute;`&iacute;l had been a disciple of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im.
Even at the moment of his execution, someone came up to
him with a message from a friend, pleading with him to
recant, but his answer was:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Zephyr, prythee bear for me a message<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that Ishmael<a name="FNanchor_FK_167" id="FNanchor_FK_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_FK_167" class="fnanchor">[FK]</a> who was not slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Living from the street of the Beloved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love permits not to return again.'<a name="Nanchor_XIII23"
id="Nanchor_XIII23"></a><a href="#Note_XIII23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-Taq&iacute; and Siyyid Murta&#7693;&aacute; were merchants
of note, and Siyyid &#7716;usayn had been a divine famed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
for his piety. Siyyid Murta&#7693;&aacute; was a brother of that Siyyid
K&aacute;&#7827;im-i-Zanj&aacute;n&iacute; who attended the B&aacute;b during His journey
to I&#7779;fah&aacute;n and later fell a martyr at <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7788;abars&iacute;. &Aacute;q&aacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-&#7716;usayn had been tortured to betray his companions,
but he would not implicate innocent men in
fictitious plots.</p>

<p>The B&aacute;b, from his remote prison in <span class="u">Ch</span>ihr&iacute;q and already
overwhelmed by calamity, eulogized these heroic men as
the 'Seven Goats' of Islamic tradition, who would precede
the promised Q&aacute;'im, their true Shepherd, to His own martyrdom.<a name="FNanchor_FL_168" id="FNanchor_FL_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_FL_168" class="fnanchor">[FL]</a></p>


<h3>The Episode of Zanj&aacute;n</h3>

<p>The fiercest and most devastating of the three military
actions against the B&aacute;b&iacute;s began in Zanj&aacute;n, in May 1850,
after the return of &#7716;ujjat from his detention in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n.
(See p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>.) Although he had enjoyed the protection of
Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h in his defence of the Faith of the B&aacute;b, he
was feared and hated as an infidel by the divines of Zanj&aacute;n.
With the death of the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h and the accession to power of
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Taq&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n under the succeeding reign, he was the
object of a concealed hostility on the part of the authorities,
while enjoying the devoted loyalty and affection of countless
men and women of his native town.</p>

<p>A small quarrel between children, in which &#7716;ujjat intervened
to save the B&aacute;b&iacute; child, sparked into flame the
smouldering animosity against &#7716;ujjat and a plan was made
to seize and bring him before the Governor. Failing in this,
his opponents subjected one of his companions to painful
injury and death. Then, by the Governor's decree, Zanj&aacute;n
was split into two opposing camps, a large number of men
were recruited from surrounding villages, and &#7716;ujjat and his
companions were forced to seek safety in the nearby fort
of `Al&iacute;-Mard&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n. Counting women and children, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
three thousand of &#7716;ujjat's supporters entered the fort,
which they held against repeated attack and siege for almost
nine months.</p>

<p>Edward Granville Browne, who visited Zanj&aacute;n nearly
forty years later, could find no natural advantages in the
fort to account for the 'desperate resistance offered by the
B&aacute;b&iacute;s', and concluded that their success in holding off the
vastly superior regiments of the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h should 'be attributed
less to the strength of the position which they occupied than
to the extraordinary valour with which they defended
themselves'.<a name="Nanchor_XIII24" id="Nanchor_XIII24"></a><a href="#Note_XIII24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a> They were sustained in their cruel ordeal by
the indomitable &#7716;ujjat, whom no calamity could overcome,
and by the tenacity of their own devotion to the B&aacute;b, their
promised Q&aacute;'im. A British observer in the 'Persian camp
before Zenjan' reported to Sheil in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n:</p>

<blockquote><p>They [the B&aacute;b&iacute;s] fight in the most obstinate and spirited
manner, the women even, of whom several have been
killed, engaging in the strife&mdash;and they are such excellent
marksmen that up to this time a good many have fallen
of the Government troops.<a name="Nanchor_XIII25" id="Nanchor_XIII25"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The most celebrated of the women was a village girl, Zaynab,
who dressed as a man and, for five months until her
death in the struggle, guarded the ramparts with the men.
&#7716;ujjat gave her the name of Rustam-`Al&iacute;.</p>

<p>Finding that all efforts to defeat the B&aacute;b&iacute;s were fruitless,
the commander determined to adopt the same treacherous
tactics as had succeeded at &#7788;abars&iacute; and Nayr&iacute;z. He drew up
a proposal for peace, assuring the defenders of the forgiveness
of the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h and pledging with a sealed copy of the
Qur'&aacute;n the safety of all who would leave the fort. &#7716;ujjat,
fully conscious of their intentions but honouring the Qur'&aacute;n,
sent a delegation of nine young children and men over
eighty to the camp of the commander. They were insolently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
received and most were thrown into a dungeon. It was the
signal for a final month-long siege, in which some eighteen
regiments were brought into action, subjecting the now
famished and depleted B&aacute;b&iacute;s to a constant bombardment of
cannon. With the wounding of &#7716;ujjat, the fort was captured,
but its occupants continued their struggle from
nearby houses, throwing the opposing army into despair.
Then &#7716;ujjat's wife and baby son were killed, and a few
days later he himself died of his wounds. There were left
of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s only two hundred able-bodied men who were
struck down in a fierce attack. When the survivors had been
inhumanly tortured, killed and their bodies mutilated, the
body of &#7716;ujjat was discovered and exposed for three days
to dishonour in the public square. Hands unknown rescued
and carried it away. Already &#7716;ujjat's eight-year-old son
had been 'literally cut into small pieces', and the wives and
daughters of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s were handed over to the
soldiers.<a name="Nanchor_XIII26" id="Nanchor_XIII26"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a><a name="FNanchor_FM_169"
id="FNanchor_FM_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_FM_169" class="fnanchor">[FM]</a></p>

<p>Yet never had the martyrs of Zanj&aacute;n sought a holy war,
nor contemplated disloyalty to their country and sovereign.
Assailed by enemies who purposed only their destruction,
they had courageously defended themselves. The spirit of
their defence shines in these words of &#7716;ujjat in his last days:</p>

<blockquote><p>The day whereon I found Thy beloved One, O my God,
and recognised in Him the Manifestation of Thy eternal
Spirit, I foresaw the woes that I should suffer for Thee....
Would that a myriad lives were mine, would that
I possessed the riches of the whole earth and its glory,
that I might resign them all freely and joyously in Thy
path.<a name="Nanchor_XIII27" id="Nanchor_XIII27"></a><a
href="#Note_XIII27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On January 6th 1851 Sheil closed his reports on Zanj&aacute;n:</p>

<blockquote><p>For the present, the doctrines of B&acirc;b have received a
check&mdash;In every part of Persia his disciples have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>crushed or scattered&mdash;But though there is a cessation of
the open promulgation of his tenets, it is believed that
in secret they are not the less cherished....<a name="Nanchor_XIII28"
id="Nanchor_XIII28"></a><a href="#Note_XIII28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Dawn-Breakers had paid dearly with their lives that
the Faith of the B&aacute;b might live on. And it did live on, to
attain its efflorescence in the Revelation of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h.</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>

<blockquote>

<p><i>I am the Primal Point from which have been generated
all created things.... I am the Countenance of God Whose
splendour can never be obscured, the Light of God Whose
radiance can never fade.... I am one of the sustaining
pillars of the Primal Word of God. Whosoever hath recognised
Me, hath known all that is true and right, and
hath attained all that is good and seemly.</i></p>

<p class="right">&mdash;The B&aacute;b</p></blockquote>


<p>On the third day after the martyrdom of the B&aacute;b, His
remains, inextricably united with those of His heroic,
faithful disciple, were placed in a casket and taken to a
locality which was safe and secure.</p>

<p>What happened, during the next fifty years, to the remains
of the B&aacute;b cannot be better summarized than in the words of
Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Subsequently, according to Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h's instructions,
they were transported to &#7788;ihr&aacute;n and placed in the shrine
of Im&aacute;m-Z&aacute;dih &#7716;asan. They were later removed to the
residence of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Sulaym&aacute;n <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_FN_170" id="FNanchor_FN_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_FN_170" class="fnanchor">[FN]</a> himself in the Sar-<span class="u">Ch</span>a<span class="u">sh</span>mih
quarter of the city, and from his house were
taken to the shrine of Im&aacute;m-Z&aacute;dih Ma`&#7779;&uacute;m, where they
remained concealed until the year 1284 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> (1867-1868),
when a Tablet, revealed by Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h in Adrianople,
directed Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;-Akbar-i-<span class="u">Sh</span>ahm&iacute;rz&aacute;d&iacute;<a name="FNanchor_FO_171" id="FNanchor_FO_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_FO_171" class="fnanchor">[FO]</a> and Jam&aacute;l-i-Bur&uacute;jird&iacute;
to transfer them without delay to some other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>spot, an instruction which, in view of the subsequent
reconstruction of that shrine, proved to have been providential.</p>

<p>Unable to find a suitable place in the suburb of <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h
`Abdu'l-`A&#7827;&iacute;m, Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;-Akbar and his companion
continued their search until, on the road leading to
<span class="u">Ch</span>a<span class="u">sh</span>mih-`Al&iacute; [the `Al&iacute; Springs], they came upon the
abandoned and dilapidated Masj&iacute;d-i-Ma<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, where
they deposited, within one of its walls, after dark, their
precious burden, having first re-wrapt the remains in a
silken shroud brought by them for that purpose. Finding
the next day to their consternation that the hiding-place
had been discovered,<a name="FNanchor_FP_172" id="FNanchor_FP_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_FP_172" class="fnanchor">[FP]</a> they clandestinely carried the casket
through the gate of the capital direct to the house of
M&iacute;rz&aacute; &#7716;asan-i-Vaz&iacute;r, a believer and son-in-law of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;y-i-Tafri<span class="u">sh</span>&iacute;, the Majdu'l-A<span class="u">sh</span>r&aacute;f, where
it remained for no less than fourteen months.<a name="FNanchor_FQ_173" id="FNanchor_FQ_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_FQ_173" class="fnanchor">[FQ]</a> The long-guarded
secret of its whereabouts becoming known to the
believers, they began to visit the house in such numbers
that a communication had to be addressed by Mull&aacute;
`Al&iacute;-Akbar to Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, begging for guidance in the
matter. &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h Mu&#7717;ammad-i-Man<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;d&iacute;, surnamed
Am&iacute;nu'l-Bay&aacute;n, was accordingly commissioned to receive
the Trust from him, and bidden to exercise the utmost
secrecy as to its disposal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p>Assisted by another believer, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h Mu&#7717;ammad
buried the casket beneath the floor of the inner sanctuary
of the shrine of Im&aacute;m-Z&aacute;dih Zayd, where it lay undetected
until M&iacute;rz&aacute; Asadu'll&aacute;h-i-I&#7779;fah&aacute;n&iacute; was informed of its exact
location through a chart forwarded to him by Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h.
Instructed by Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h to conceal it elsewhere, he first
removed the remains to his own house in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, after
which they were deposited in several other localities
such as the house of &#7716;usayn-`Al&iacute;y-i-I&#7779;fah&aacute;n&iacute; and that of
Mu&#7717;ammad-Kar&iacute;m-i-`A&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;r, where they remained hidden
until the year 1316 (1899) <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span>, when, in pursuance of
directions issued by `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, this same M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Asadu'll&aacute;h, together with a number of other believers,
transported them by way of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n, Kirm&aacute;n<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;h,
Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d and Damascus, to Beirut and thence by sea to
`Akk&aacute;, arriving at their destination on the 19th of the
month of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n 1316 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> (January 31, 1899),
fifty lunar years after the B&aacute;b's execution in Tabr&iacute;z.<a name="Nanchor_E1"
id="Nanchor_E1"></a><a href="#Note_E1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Forty years after the martyrdom of the B&aacute;b, on a day in
spring, Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h was standing under the shade of a cluster
of cypress trees on the slopes of Mount Carmel. In front of
Him stretched the curve of the Bay of Haifa, beyond which
loomed a sinister sight, the grim citadel of `Akk&aacute;&mdash;His first
abode when He was brought, a Prisoner and an Exile, to the
Holy Land. In darkest days He had told His people not to
grieve, the prison gates would open and He would raise
His tent on the fair mountain across the bay.</p>

<p>He it was Whose advent the B&aacute;b had come to herald.
For Him&mdash;He Whom God shall make manifest&mdash;the young
Martyr-Prophet had suffered tribulations, had sacrificed His
life. In His Dispensation, the Dispensation of His Forerunner
had found its fulfilment, regained its splendour. And
now as Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h&mdash;the Lord of Hosts&mdash;looked at the
expanse of rock below those cypress trees (which today still
stand, firm and proud), He told His Son, `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, who
would shortly wield authority in His Name, that a mausoleum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
should be raised on that mountain-mass to receive the remains
of the B&aacute;b.</p>

<p>A decade went by before `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; could carry out
that command. The sons of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, who had strayed
away from His Covenant, strove hard to block the enterprise.
But at last the land was secured, the access route was
obtained, the foundation-stone was laid, and construction
work had begun. Then the mischief wrought by those
violators of the Covenant of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h led to the incarceration
of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; within the walls of `Akk&aacute;. His life
was in peril, but though, for a while, all His activities were
either curtailed or stopped, the work of constructing that
mausoleum on Mount Carmel was never allowed to lapse.</p>

<p>In the year 1908, the despotism of the Ottoman rulers
came to an end, and `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; found His freedom. The
next year on Naw-R&uacute;z Day&mdash;March 21st&mdash;in a vault
beneath the building which He had raised with undaunted
resolution and with heart-ache, He deposited the casket
containing the remains of the B&aacute;b within a marble sarcophagus,
the gift of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s of Rangoon. Nearly forty
years later, Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;
Faith, undertook to adorn the Shrine of the B&aacute;b with a
superstructure, both strong and beautiful, crowned with a
golden dome. Today it shines dazzlingly in the heart of
Mount Carmel&mdash;the Mountain of God&mdash;a spiritual home for
a flourishing world community and a beacon of hope for
the whole of mankind.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX I<br />
THE SIEGE OF KARBIL&Aacute;</h2>


<p>The best and fullest account of the upheavals in Karbil&aacute;
is contained in a sixty-six-page dispatch from Lt.-Col.
Farrant, the British Special Commissioner, to Sir Stratford
Canning (later Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe), the British
Ambassador in Istanbul.<a name="Nanchor_AI1" id="Nanchor_AI1"></a><a
href="#Note_AI1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His description of the position
and the condition of Karbil&aacute; is particularly worthy of
note:</p>

<p>"The town of Kerbella is situated about four hours
distance from the right bank of the Euphrates on the confines
of the Syrian desert, south south west of Bagdad about
55 miles distant, and is about 1-3/4 miles in circumference,
surrounded by a brick wall about 24 feet high with twenty
nine bastions each of which is capable of containing one
gun&mdash;it contains 3400 houses of a very inferior description;
the houses closely crowded together approach within
three yards of the wall&mdash;the streets are very narrow, the
tops of the houses are surrounded by a brick parapet and
can be fired from without exposure, it has six gates three of
which are very small&mdash;The tomb of Imaum Hossein is a
fine building and stands nearly in the centre of the town, that
of his brother Abbas in the South East quarter about two
hundred and fifty yards from the Najif gate. The town is
surrounded by gardens which approach close to the walls,
leaving only a small footpath. The gardens are filled with
huge date trees, intersected with numerous ditches, and
extend to some distance from the town which is not perceptible
until you are close under the walls. Its strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
consists in its situation, but it appeared to me that a few
good troops ought to be able to take it in a short time. The
houses mostly belonged to Persians who have left their
country and settled there for generations. Many of the rich
men in Persia have houses and land there, that in time of
need they may have a safe place of refuge, or wishing in
their old age to retire to a place held in such veneration by
them&mdash;</p>

<p>'The population varies from ten thousand to twenty
thousand and eighty thousand, it is always fluctuating, and
I was informed that during the time the pilgrims arrive, the
streets are almost impassable&mdash;The houses are mostly
divided into several small courts, occasionally one hundred
persons are crowded into one of these houses, which to
outward appearance could with difficulty contain half that
number&mdash;The poorer pilgrims take up their abodes in the
Courts of the Mosques&mdash;</p>

<p>'The working classes at Kerbella viz Bakers small shopkeepers
day labourers &amp;c. were all Persians.'</p>

<p>Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; had warned the Persian, the British and the
French Agents that he intended to attack Karbil&aacute;. In a long
letter addressed to the Persian Agent in Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d dated
<span class="u">Sh</span>avv&aacute;l 16th 1258 (November 18th 1842), he had, after
detailing the history of the rebellion in Karbil&aacute; and its
consequences, uttered this clear warning:</p>

<p>'Being, however, near the shrines of Ali &amp; Hoosein
[&#7716;usayn] I thought it my duty to visit them; with this
auspicious determination I proceeded thither, when the
rebel above named [Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m Za`far&aacute;n&iacute;]<a name="FNanchor_FR_174" id="FNanchor_FR_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_FR_174" class="fnanchor">[FR]</a> declared that if I
came with troops he would not permit my entrance; and I
ascertained that he had also prepared the means of opposition.
To withdraw in this position of affairs from my publickly
announced purpose was a difficult step; &amp; should the
report of it spread abroad, it might, God forbid, affect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
whole order of government, the rejection, too, of the petitions
of loyal &amp; suffering subjects, who are the most sacred
charge of the deity to us, is contrary to all the rules &amp;
requirements of justice; I therefore, determined to proceed,
under the Imperial shadow, and the aid of the Almighty to
the punishment of the rebels, as a warning example to his
equals; &amp; if, as I hear, he is prepared for resistance he shall
submit to my entrance by force. There are many subjects
of Iran in the town alluded to; let there hereafter be no
claims, on the part of that high power, in behalf of these
persons; let them come out with their children, families
and property ... in fact they must not be in that town in
the hour of hostility, as this is quite inconsistent with the
state of the town &amp; place. You must therefore in compliance
with your duty in such cases, without delay, inform, all
those whom it may concern, of these facts; for which
friendly aid this letter is written and despatched; and, please
God you will doubtless thus act on the receipt thereof, &amp;
without delay favour me with a reply to the same.'<a name="Nanchor_AI2"
id="Nanchor_AI2"></a><a href="#Note_AI2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>However, no warning was given to the Persians to quit
Karbil&aacute; as Farrant's report makes clear: 'The Mollahs also
excited the religious feelings of the peoples, making them
believe it was a common cause, a religious war, a Persian
seyd who was present, stated to me that many of the Persians
fought or gave assistance, that he amongst many did
not leave the town, thinking it would not be taken, and
rumours were spread that the Shah was sending a large
force to their assistance, he also stated that those Persians
who were unfitted or refused to bear arms were obliged to
give money ... likewise they considered themselves safe,
as their Consul did not come to order them away.'</p>

<p>Instead, Farrant reports: 'The Persian Consul in reply to
the Pacha begged him to postpone his intended attack, that
if the town was taken by assault many innocent people
(Persian subjects) would suffer, who at present were unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
to come away ... that if he would delay his expedition for
four or six months to give the Persians time to arrange their
affairs, he would proceed to Kerbella, and bring the Persians
away, and arrange everything for him.</p>

<p>'Three days before receiving the Pacha's letter, the Consul
asserts he wrote privately to the Chief Priest Hajee Seid
Kausem saying "we hear the Pacha will move on Kerbella,
and if he is determined, he will certainly come, he is not an
Ali Pacha&mdash;tell the Persians they had better come out&mdash;"
After the receipt of the Pacha's official letter he again wrote
to the Chief Priest [Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im] of the Pacha's fixed
determination, and requested him to tell all the Persians to
quit the town&mdash;This letter he sent by a confidential person,
but it appears it never reached, as the Chief Priest declares
he never wrote to him, although he requested him to come
to Kerbella&mdash;'</p>

<p>Farrant goes on to say: 'The Pacha would not listen to the
propositions of the Consul&mdash;H.R.H. The Zel-i Sultan (son
of the late Shah of Persia, a refugee) accompanied by Hajee
Seid Kausem Chief Priest, Seid Wahab Governor<a name="FNanchor_FS_175" id="FNanchor_FS_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_FS_175" class="fnanchor">[FS]</a> of
Kerbella, Seid Hossainee and Seid Nasseroola [Siyyid
Na&#7779;ru'll&aacute;h], influential people of Kerbella, came to the Pacha's
camp at Mossaib and remained four days&mdash;The Pacha told
them he did not wish to injure the people, that Kerbella
was in rebellion and belonged to the Sultan...' However,
he was willing to make concessions, should the people of
Karbil&aacute; submit to his rule and let soldiers be stationed in
their city.</p>

<p>Farrant further relates: 'The Pacha told His R.H. the Zel
i Sultan and Chief Priest before leaving his camp to warn all
Persians to separate themselves from the Geramees (and
gave the Prince a paper to that effect) that if they could
not leave the town, they should retire altogether to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
quarter of it, or else with their families and property seek
protection in the Courts of the tombs of Hoossein and
Abbas, for he was determined to proceed to extremities
if the Kerbellai's refused to submit to his orders...'</p>

<p>Farrant reports a second excursion by &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im
and `Al&iacute;-<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, the &#7826;illu's-Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, on behalf of the people
of Karbil&aacute;, this time to the camp of Sa`du'll&aacute;h P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;, the
Colonel commissioned by Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; to invest the city.
'About the 1st January [1843],' writes Farrant, 'the Persian
Consul accompanied by Seid Ibrahim Kasveenee<a name="FNanchor_FT_176" id="FNanchor_FT_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_FT_176" class="fnanchor">[FT]</a> arrived
at Najib Pacha's camp at Mossaib from Bagdad&mdash;The army
had now been eleven days before Kerbella and much fighting
had taken place, and many on both sides had been killed.'
The talks which Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-`Az&iacute;z (Persian Consul) and
Siyyid Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m had with Naj&iacute;b P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; bore no result, and as
Farrant reports: 'The Consul and Chief Priest returned to
Bagdad, they had been four or five days in the Pacha's
camp&mdash;The Chief Priest in Kerbella Hajee Seid Kausem it
is said (he told me also the same thing) wrote to the Persian
Consul and Seid Ibrahim Kasveenee begging the former to
come on to Kerbella, that "his presence was necessary, it was
the hour of danger"&mdash;This letter was received by them
after they had quitted the Pacha's camp about two hours.
Rumours in the town were very prevalent, that the Shah
of Persia was sending an army of twenty thousand men to
their assistance, which gave great confidence to the Persians
inside&mdash;Persians have informed me that they heard these
reports and many believed them, also they have most positively
assured me that their Consul never wrote or communicated
with them, and on learning, that he had returned
to Bagdad, did not consider there was any danger. The
Consul asserts he wrote to the Chief Priest Hajee Seid
Kausem, which the latter most positively denies....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>
<p>'... The walls were daily crowded,' Farrant writes, 'by
the inhabitants who vented the grossest abuse on the Sultan,
and cursed the soldiers and their religion. The chief people
in Kerbella did all in their power to excite the religious
feelings of the Sheeahs against the Soonies, the Priests also
were most active, I have been told, and as they could not
fight, repaired any damages the walls might receive. They
prayed also in the Mosques encouraging and exciting the
people by telling them it was a religious war.'</p>

<p>And then came the final assault. Farrant reports: 'Before
daylight on the 13 January the storming party moved from
Camp accompanied by the main body which halted at the
battery, a soldier advanced and clambered up the breach,
observing that the guards had left their posts, and the few
who remained were asleep at the bottom of the wall round
a fire&mdash;he returned to the Seraskier and reported what he
had seen&mdash;</p>

<p>'The storming party was then ordered to move forward...'</p>

<p>There was panic and slaughter. Farrant states that the
sanctuary of the tomb of `Abb&aacute;s was violated, but Sa`du'll&aacute;h
P&aacute;<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute; personally intervened to prevent the desecration of the
Shrine of Im&aacute;m &#7716;usayn. The boastful leaders fled the city
and as Farrant puts it: 'The principal cause of the late affair
at Kerbella may be ascribed to the chiefs of that place who
supported the Geramees in opposition to the Government,
and in the time of danger withdrew from the contest and
left the innocent and helpless to the fury of the soldiers.'
'Many flung themselves over the walls and were dashed to
pieces,' Farrant reports, 'whilst others sought shelter in the
houses of H.R.H. The Zil i Sultan and Hajee Seid Kausem
[Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im] Chief Priest, the latter shewed me a court in
his house where 66 persons of all ages and sexes were suffocated,
or crushed to death flying from the fury of the
soldiers...'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>Farrant further reports: 'No Prince of the Royal blood nor
any Persian of rank were [sic] killed, the sufferers were all
of the poorer classes, small shopkeepers and labourers,
also a few learned men&mdash;The wife of Prince Holakoo
Meerza [Hul&aacute;k&uacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;] was severely wounded by a soldier
(she is closely connected with the Shah of Persia being a
daughter of the late Hoossein Ali Meerza Prince Governor
of Fars).... The Secretary of Seid Ibrahim Kasveenee
Chief Priest; Seid Mahomed Ali Moosvee [Siyyid Mu&#7717;ammad-`Al&iacute;y-i-M&uacute;sav&iacute;]
was seized by the soldiers and forced
to carry outside the walls some plunder for them, he stated
who he was, but it was of no avail, on arriving outside the
gate, they cut off his head and took it to the cashier of the
Seraskier Pacha for a reward&mdash;he was a young man much
respected.... The house of Alee Werdee Khan [`Al&iacute;-Vird&iacute;
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n] (an uncle of the present Shah) was also entered by the
soldiers, this house was defended by the Arabs. The Khan
jumped into a well to save his life, one of his servants went
and informed the Seraskier who immediately sent some men
to his relief&mdash;The Khan was taken to the Seraskier nearly
dead with cold, who sent him into the haram [Shrine] of
Hoossein for safety&mdash;Why the Khan did not leave the town
before the siege is a mystery, it is said that he was very active
in advising the Persians to remain in the town&mdash;'</p>

<p>The exaggerated reports from Mull&aacute; `Abdu'l-`Az&iacute;z, the
Persian Agent in Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d, had served to heighten the crisis.
He had apparently been slack in the exercise of his duties
and when the siege was over, alarmed by the magnitude of
the disaster, he endeavoured to make a quick getaway from
Ba<span class="u">gh</span>d&aacute;d. Although the following report which he made to
the Prime Minister of &Iacute;r&aacute;n, &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute; &Aacute;q&aacute;s&iacute;, is unreliable
and highly-coloured, it is of sufficient interest to reproduce.</p>

<p>'In short,' he wrote, 'there is no one left in Kerbelah, and
of those who are alive, they are either wounded, naked or
destitute of property. According to what is described, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
5,000 persons were killed in the shrine of Abbass,<a name="FNanchor_FU_177" id="FNanchor_FU_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_FU_177" class="fnanchor">[FU]</a> and
property pillaged is beyond estimate&mdash;no one has anything
left. Whatever the people of Persia possessed was brought
to this place; afterwards it will become known, what quantity
of Persian property was there.... Whatever Ali Nakee
Meerza [`Al&iacute;-Naq&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;] and Imam Verdee Meerza [Im&aacute;m-Vird&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute;] (sons of Fatteh Ali Shah [Fat&#7717;-`Al&iacute; <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h])
possessed was plundered even to the stripping naked their
wives.... The wives of the people who were not killed
were made captives.... Moollah Ali a person belonging to
Ali Pasha, who is at present in the service of Mahomed
Nejeeb Pasha, interceded for the women&mdash;Sadoollah Pasha
(Colonel) replied, that "the troops being without women,
they must remain some nights with them, after which we will
dismiss them"...</p>

<p>'Besides what I have related, the two shrines were converted
into barracks, and all the troops which are in Kerbelah
have been quartered in the two shrines with their
horses and cattle&mdash;They have tied their cattle in the apartments
of the shrine and the college, and the troops have made
their own quarters in the corridor and private apartments,
and twice a day their drums and band play within the
shrine&mdash;On whatever persons they wish to inflict punishment,
it is done within the shrine of Imam Hoossein....
The remainder of the Sheeahs, who are in Nejeff, Hillah,
Kazimeyn and Bagdad are dispirited to such a degree, that
they have not the courage to weep at this calamity&mdash;</p>

<p>'All those who were in the private apartments of Hajee
Syed Kazim (Chief Priest) and in the house of Ali Shah
(Zil.e.Sultan) remained in safety&mdash;at the most about 200
persons were killed in the outer apartments of Hajee Syed
Kazim....</p>

<p>'From the commencement to the close of the siege occupied
24 days&mdash;and from the day that the Pasha informed me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
he would send troops against Kerbelah until they arrived
there occupied 15 days, and notwithstanding my wishes
that he would delay, until the people of Persia should quit
Kerbelah, he neither gave any delay nor opportunity for
their doing so....</p>

<p>'On account of these circumstances, the stay of your
devoted servant in Bagdad is needless&mdash;As yet I have received
no money from Kermanshah, if you were graciously
pleased to grant it, and wrote to the Shoojah ood. dowleh
[<span class="u">Sh</span>uj&aacute;`u'd-Dawlih], to send some money speedily to me
your devoted servant, to pay some of my debts,<a name="FNanchor_FV_178" id="FNanchor_FV_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_FV_178" class="fnanchor">[FV]</a> it is possible
that I might be able to bring the Zil.i.Sultan<a name="FNanchor_FW_179" id="FNanchor_FW_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_FW_179" class="fnanchor">[FW]</a> along
with me.'<a name="Nanchor_AI3" id="Nanchor_AI3"></a><a

<h2>APPENDIX 2<br />
THE MARTYRDOM OF THE B&Aacute;B</h2>


<p>The martyrdom of the B&aacute;b was reported by Lt.-Col. Sheil
to Lord Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary, on
July 22nd 1850:</p>

<p>'The founder of this sect has been executed at Tabreez&mdash;He
was killed by a volley of musketry, and his death was on
the point of giving his religion a lustre which would have
largely increased its proselytes. When the smoke and dust
cleared away after the volley, B&aacute;b was not to be seen, and
the populace proclaimed that he had ascended to the skies&mdash;The
balls had broken the ropes by which he was bound,
but he was dragged from the recess where after some search,
he was discovered, and shot.</p>

<p>'His death according to the belief of his disciples will
make no difference, as B&acirc;b must always exist.'<a name="Nanchor_AII1"
id="Nanchor_AII1"></a><a href="#Note_AII1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>At the time of the martyrdom of the B&aacute;b, R. W. Stevens,
the British Consul, was absent from Tabr&iacute;z, and his brother,
George, was left in charge of the Consulate. The latter had
failed to report the event to Sheil. On July 24th, R. W.
Stevens, back at his post, rectified that omission and added
that the body of the B&aacute;b and His disciple had been 'thrown
into the Town ditch where they were devoured by dogs.'<a name="Nanchor_AII2"
id="Nanchor_AII2"></a><a href="#Note_AII2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Sheil wrote to Palmerston, on August 15th, that 'Although
the advice and opinions of foreign agents are generally
unpalatable to the Persian Minister, I nevertheless think it
my duty to bring under his observation any flagrant abuse
or outrage that reaches my knowledge. I persuade myself
that on such occasions notwithstanding the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
acknowledgement on the part of the Ameer-i-Nizam [M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Taq&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n, the Grand Vizier], he may perhaps privately
take steps for applying a remedy.' He went on to say that
the Consul at Tabr&iacute;z had reported that the body of the B&aacute;b,
'by order of the Ameer-i-Nizam's brother, was thrown into
the ditch of the town to be devoured by dogs, which
actually happened.'<a name="Nanchor_AII3" id="Nanchor_AII3"></a><a
href="#Note_AII3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He enclosed the copy of the letter he
had written to the Grand Vizier on this subject. This is
what he wrote to M&iacute;rz&aacute; Taq&iacute; <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n:</p>

<p>'Your Excellency is aware of the warm interest taken by
the British Government in all that concerns the honor,
respectability and credit of this Government, and it is on
this account I make you acquainted with a recent occurrence
in Tabreez which perhaps has not been brought to Your
Excellency's knowledge&mdash;The execution of the Pretender
Bab in that city was accompanied by a circumstance which if
published in the Gazettes of Europe would throw the utmost
discredit on the Persian Ministers. After that person was put
to death, his body by orders of the Vezeer.i.Nizam was
thrown into the ditch of the town to be devoured by dogs,
which actually happened&mdash;This act resembles the deeds of
bye gone ages, and could not I believe now occur in any
country between China and England&mdash;Feeling satisfied that
it did not receive Your Excellency's sanction, and knowing
what sentiments it would excite in Europe, I have thought
it proper to write this friendly communication, not to
let you remain in ignorance of the occurrence.'<a name="Nanchor_AII4"
id="Nanchor_AII4"></a><a href="#Note_AII4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Palmerston wrote back on October 8th: '... Her Majesty's
Government approve of your having called the attention of
the Ameer-i-Nizam ... to the manner in which the corpse
of the Pretender B&acirc;b was treated after his execution at
Tabreez.'<a name="Nanchor_AII5" id="Nanchor_AII5"></a><a

<h2>APPENDIX 3<br />
PRELUDE TO THE EPISODE OF NAYR&Iacute;Z</h2>


<p>On February 12th 1850, Lt.-Col. Sheil, back at his post in
&#7788;ihr&aacute;n after a long leave of absence, reported to Lord
Palmerston:</p>

<p>'... a serious outbreak lately took place at Yezd, which
however the Governor of that city with the assistance of
the priesthood succeeded in quelling&mdash;</p>

<p>'The exciters of the insurrection were the partizans of the
new Sect called Babee, who assembled in such numbers as
to force the Governor to take refuge in the citadel, to which
they laid siege&mdash;The Moollas conscious that the progress of
Babeeism is the decay of their own supremacy determined
to rescue the Governor, and summoning the populace in
the name of religion to attack this new Sect of infidels, the
Babees were overthrown and forced to take flight to the
adjoining province of Kerman....</p>

<p>'The tenets of this new religion seem to be spreading in
Persia&mdash;Bab the founder, a native of Sheeraz, who has
assumed this fictitious name, is imprisoned in Azerbijan,
but in every large town he has disciples, who with the fanaticism
or fortitude so often seen among the adherents of new
doctrines, are ready to meet death.... Bab declares himself
to be Imam Mehdee, the last Imam, who disappeared from
human sight but is to reappear on earth&mdash;His decrees supersede
the Koran among his disciples, who not only revere
him as the head of their faith, but also obey him as the
temporal Sovereign of the world, to whom all other
monarchs must submit&mdash;Besides this inconvenient doctrine,
they have adopted other tenets pernicious to society....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>'Conversion by the sword is not yet avowed, argument
and inspiration from heaven being the present means of
instilling or attaining faith in the Mission of Bab&mdash;If left
to their own merits the not novel doctrines of this Preacher
will doubtless sink into insignificancy, it is persecution only
which can save them from neglect and contempt, and unluckily
the proselytes are all of the Mahommedan faith,
which is inflexible in the punishment of a relapsed Mussulman&mdash;Thus
both the temporal and religious authorities
have an interest in the extermination of this Sect.</p>

<p>'It is conjectured that in Teheran this religion has acquired
votaries in every class, not even excluding the artillery and
regular Infantry&mdash;Their numbers in this city, it is supposed,
may amount to about two thousand.'<a name="Nanchor_AIII1"
id="Nanchor_AIII1"></a><a href="#Note_AIII1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><a name="FNanchor_FX_180" id="FNanchor_FX_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_FX_180" class="fnanchor">[FX]</a></p>

<p>The incident at Yazd, which the British Minister was
reporting to the Foreign Secretary, concerned the activities
of a man named Mu&#7717;ammad-`Abdu'll&aacute;h, who professed
belief in the new Revelation. Va&#7717;&iacute;d was in Yazd at the
time, fearlessly proclaiming the advent of the Q&aacute;'im.
Navv&aacute;b-i-Ra&#7693;av&iacute;, an influential man of the city, who hated
Va&#7717;&iacute;d as much as Sa`&iacute;du'l-`Ulam&aacute; had hated Qudd&uacute;s,<a name="FNanchor_FY_181" id="FNanchor_FY_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_FY_181" class="fnanchor">[FY]</a> was
plotting to destroy him. Despite Va&#7717;&iacute;d's injunction,
Mu&#7717;ammad-`Abdu'll&aacute;h went ahead with his own schemes
which resulted in clashes with the civil authority, and his
own death. Va&#7717;&iacute;d was forced to leave Yazd in the dead of
night, on foot. His house in Yazd was pillaged, and his
servant &#7716;asan was seized and put to death. While horsemen
sent by his adversaries were searching for him, he hid in the
mountains; and by mountain tracks made his way to Bav&aacute;n&aacute;t
in the province of F&aacute;rs. There were many in that area who
gave him whole-hearted support, among them the renowned
&#7716;&aacute;j&iacute; Siyyid Ism&aacute;`&iacute;l, the <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>u'l-Isl&aacute;m of Bav&aacute;n&aacute;t.
Then by way of Fas&aacute; he approached the city of Nayr&iacute;z.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX 4<br />
THE SEVEN MARTYRS OF &#7788;IHR&Aacute;N</h2>


<p>In the course of 1849, Prince Dolgorukov, the Russian
Minister in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, had protested to the Persian Government
that while going into the presence of the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h he
had been forced to witness the dragging away of the writhing
corpses of eight criminals, executed in front of the <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h.
Dolgorukov considered it an affront to him, the envoy of
the Tsar, to be presented with such a spectacle. Sheil had
backed Dolgorukov's protest.<a name="Nanchor_AIV1" id="Nanchor_AIV1"></a><a
href="#Note_AIV1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Palmerston had, in turn,
approved Sheil's action. On February 12th 1850, Prince
Dolgorukov sent this report to Count Nesselrode in St.
Petersburg:</p>

<p>'Minds are in an extraordinarily excited state due to the
execution which has just taken place in the great square of
Tihran. I have already once expressed my opinion that the
method by which last year the troops of the Shah under the
command of Prince Mahdi Quli Mirza exterminated the
Babis will not lessen their fanaticism.</p>

<p>'From that time on the Government has learned that
Tihran is full of these dangerous sectaries who do not
recognize civil statutes and preach the partitioning of the
property of those who do not join their doctrine. Becoming
fearful for the social peace, the ministers of Persia decided
to arrest some of these sectaries and, according to the
common version, having received during the interrogation
their confession of their faith, executed them. These persons,
numbering seven, and arrested at random, since the
Babis are counted already by thousands within the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
capital, would by no means deny their faith and met death
with an exultation which could only be explained as fanaticism
brought to its extreme limit. The Assistant Minister
of Foreign Affairs, Mirza Muhammad Ali, on the contrary
affirms that those people have confessed nothing and that
their silence was interpreted as a sufficient proof of their
guilt.</p>

<p>'One can only regret the blindness of the Shah's authorities
who imagine that such measures could extinguish
religious fanaticism, as well as the injustice which guides
their actions when examples of cruelty, with which they are
trying to frighten the people, are committed without distinction
against the first passer-by who falls into their
hands...'<a name="Nanchor_AIV2" id="Nanchor_AIV2"></a><a
href="#Note_AIV2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Ten days later (February 22nd 1850), Sheil wrote to
Palmerston that apparently the advice tendered by Her
Majesty's Government that criminals should not be executed
in the presence of the Sovereign had had some effect, because
a few days before, seven B&aacute;b&iacute;s, accused of conspiring
to assassinate the Grand Vizier, had been put to death in
public with no untoward incident. Sheil asserted that this
fact proved the feasibility of public executions. M&iacute;rz&aacute; Taq&iacute;
<span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;n had earlier stated that with executions in public there
was the risk of a malefactor being snatched and spirited
away. Sheil felt, however, that on this occasion there was
sympathy for the executed, because the story of a conspiracy
to murder the Grand Vizier was not generally
believed. He further observed that the B&aacute;b&iacute;s had been offered
their lives, were they to recant, and they had firmly refused
to do so. His own comment to the Grand Vizier had been
that executing the B&aacute;b&iacute;s was the surest way of propagating
their doctrines.<a name="Nanchor_AIV3" id="Nanchor_AIV3"></a><a
href="#Note_AIV3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Lord Palmerston in answer to Sheil stated that Her
Majesty's Government was pleased to learn that N&aacute;&#7779;iri'd-D&iacute;n
<span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h had agreed with the advice not to have executions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
carried out in his presence, but added, 'the punishment of
men for religious belief, besides being unjust and cruel, is
also an erroneous practice, and tends to encourage and propagate
the belief which it is intended to suppress.'<a name="Nanchor_AIV4"

<h2>APPENDIX 5<br />
THE EPISODE OF ZANJ&Aacute;N</h2>


<p>The episode of Zanj&aacute;n covered the period from May to
December 1850, and much engaged the attention of the
British and Russian envoys. On May 25th Sheil reported
to Palmerston: 'At Zenjan ... an attempt at insurrection
was made by the Sect of the Babees whose leader is the chief
priest of the town&mdash;Five hours after the receipt of this
intelligence a Battalion of Infantry 400 horse and three guns
marched towards Zenjan&mdash;This is an instance unexampled
in Persia of military celerity, which perhaps would not be
surpassed in many countries of Europe.'<a name="Nanchor_AV1" id="Nanchor_AV1"></a><a
href="#Note_AV1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A month later,
Sheil reported: 'The insurrection at Zenjan has not yet been
quelled. The B&acirc;bees of that city continue to defend themselves
with the zeal of proselytes and the contempt of life
inculcated by their faith...'<a name="Nanchor_AV2" id="Nanchor_AV2"></a><a
href="#Note_AV2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Prince Dolgorukov, the Russian Minister, commented
on July 31st: 'The Government has exhausted all possible
means to compel the Babis to submit voluntarily. Muhammad
Ali who heads the two or three hundred of these
fanatics in Zanjan, has fortified himself in one of the quarters
of the said town and terrifies the inhabitants. The Amir was
finally forced to take energetic measures, and the former
beglerbegi of Tabriz, Muhammad Khan, has just been sent
against them with an army of 2000 men and four cannons.'<a name="Nanchor_AV3"
id="Nanchor_AV3"></a><a href="#Note_AV3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Dolgorukov had grossly underestimated the number of the
B&aacute;b&iacute;s. (See pp. <a href="#Page_185">185</a>-<a href="#Page_186">6</a>.)</p>

<p>Sheil wrote on August 22nd: 'The B&acirc;bees of Zenjan still
continue to maintain that nearly defenceless city against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Shah's troops.'<a name="Nanchor_AV4" id="Nanchor_AV4"></a><a
href="#Note_AV4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> On September 5th he reported: '... these
fanatics are reduced to a few hundred fighting men, they
continue to maintain a hopeless contest, with undaunted
resolution, refusing submission on any terms...'<a name="Nanchor_AV5"
id="Nanchor_AV5"></a><a href="#Note_AV5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Dolgorukov reported on September 14th: 'The Babis,
who are engaged there in a life and death struggle against
the troops of the Shah, are still resisting the attacks of
Muhammad Khan, and one can only wonder at the fierceness
with which they meet the danger of their situation. Their
leader Mulla Muhammad Ali, has appealed to the Turkish
Minister, Sami Effendi, and also to Colonel Sheil for their
mediation. However, my English colleague is of the
opinion that it would be very difficult to force the Persian
Government to consent to foreign intervention in favor of
the above mentioned sectaries.'<a name="Nanchor_AV6" id="Nanchor_AV6"></a><a
href="#Note_AV6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> On October 6th, the
Russian Minister was in a petulant mood: 'I think it would
have been better if they [the Persian Government] had given
more serious attention to the affairs of Zanjan. The Babis
have been fighting against 6000 of the Shah's best troops
for almost five months now, and Muhammad Khan, who is
already master of three quarters of the city, cannot take the
quarter which they have fortified themselves and are
defending ... with a heroism and a fury worthy of a better
application.'<a name="Nanchor_AV7" id="Nanchor_AV7"></a><a
href="#Note_AV7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In his dispatch of November 9th, Dolgorukov
wrote: 'New military units have just been dispatched
against the Babis of Zanjan. This time the Governor
of that city, a brother of the Shah's mother, Amir Aslan
Khan, is accused of provoking the resistance, which the
Babis offer the Shah's army, by his incautious behavior.'<a
name="Nanchor_AV8" id="Nanchor_AV8"></a><a href="#Note_AV8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
And, at last, on December 26th Dolgorukov could report:
'The Zanjan disturbances have ended. After a siege which
lasted for almost six months the Shah's troops have destroyed
the center of the rebellion. The Babis who defended
themselves to the last, and whose numbers were finally
reduced to twenty men, who sought refuge in a cellar, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
torn to pieces. In addition to monetary expenditures, this
struggle has cost Persia 1500 in killed and disabled.'<a name="Nanchor_AV9"
id="Nanchor_AV9"></a><a href="#Note_AV9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Sheil had been reporting on September 25th:
'The disciples of B&acirc;b have barricaded a portion of that town,
from which they cannot be expelled without a greater loss
of life than the assailants seem willing to encounter.'<a name="Nanchor_AV10"
id="Nanchor_AV10"></a><a href="#Note_AV10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And
he wrote on October 25th: 'Contrary to all rational expectation
the small portion of Zenjan occupied by the B&acirc;bees
continues to set at defiance the efforts of the Shah's troops to
expel that sect from the City.' In the same dispatch he stated
that 'General Sir Henry Bethune who visited the scene of
operations, expressed a conviction that three hours with
ordinary troops would finish the affair...'<a name="Nanchor_AV11"
id="Nanchor_AV11"></a><a href="#Note_AV11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Bethune was
the man who had helped Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h to his throne.
Sheil seems to have become wearied of reporting on Zanj&aacute;n,
for on November 23rd he wrote: 'I continue unable to make
any variation in my reports relative to Zenjan&mdash;The same
feeble ineffectual attempts at assault, the same repulses still
mark the progress of the siege.' Then he made the extraordinary
assertion that it had been affirmed that the defenders
of Zanj&aacute;n were not B&aacute;b&iacute;s at all, that they had been
heard to 'proclaim from the walls in hearing of the troops,
the creed that "there is no God but God, and Mahomed is
his prophet."' Those men were fighting, it was said, because
of the enormities perpetrated by the troops. Even
more extraordinary is this fantastic and incredibly false
statement in that same dispatch of November 23rd: 'Moolla
Mahomed Ali, their chief, has the reputation of having
proclaimed himself to be the true B&acirc;b, and his predecessor
to have been an impostor.'<a name="Nanchor_AV12" id="Nanchor_AV12"></a><a
href="#Note_AV12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> On December 16th Sheil
wrote to Palmerston: 'Her Majesty's Consul at Tabreez
having informed me that great atrocities are committed at
Zenjan by the soldiery particularly by their shocking treatment
of such women as have been captured, I brought the
circumstances to the knowledge of the Persian Minister&mdash;The Ameer-i.Nizam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
thanked me for the information, and
said he would take immediate steps for preventing such
barbarous proceedings, which are entirely opposed to his
sentiments and feelings&mdash;' '... the mode in which my
communication was received by the Ameer. i. Nizam shows
an improvement in his tone, and in the temper with which
he listens to suggestions of the above nature.'<a name="Nanchor_AV13"
id="Nanchor_AV13"></a><a href="#Note_AV13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>On December 24th, Sheil reported to Palmerston: 'This
protracted siege, if siege it can be called, is inexplicable&mdash;An
English gentleman who lately passed through Zenjan informed
me a few days ago that the portion of the town
occupied by the B&acirc;bees is confined to three or four houses,
and that their numbers are utterly insignificant&mdash;They have
adopted a mode of defence which seems to exceed the
military skill of the Persian commanders&mdash;The entire of the
space included within these houses is mined or excavated and
connected by passages. Here the B&acirc;bees live in safety from
the shot and shells of the assailants, who evidently have no
predilection for underground warfare.'<a name="Nanchor_AV14"
id="Nanchor_AV14"></a><a href="#Note_AV14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Lord Palmerston on February 11th 1851 wrote to Sheil
that '... Her Majesty's Government approve of your
having called the attention of the Ameer-i-Nizam ... to
the acts of violence committed by the Persian Troops against
Zenjan.'<a name="Nanchor_AV15" id="Nanchor_AV15"></a><a

<p>And finally, here is the last report of Sheil on the episode
of Zanj&aacute;n. It is dated January 6th 1851. 'I have the honor
to report to Your Lordship that Zenjan has been at length
captured&mdash;Moolla Mahomed Ali, the leader of the insurgents,
had received a wound in the arm, which terminated
in his death&mdash;His followers dismayed by the loss of their
chief, yielded to an assault which their relaxation in the
energy of their defence encouraged the commander of the
Shah's troops to make&mdash;This success was followed by a
great atrocity&mdash;The pusillanimity of the troops, which the
events of this siege had rendered so notorious, was equalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
by their ferocity&mdash;All the captives were bayonetted by the
soldiers in cold blood, to avenge ... the slaughter of their
comrades&mdash;Religious hatred may have conspired with the
feelings excited by a blood feud, which among the tribes
are very strong, to cause this ruthless act&mdash;Four hundred
persons are said to have perished in this way, among whom
it is believed were some women and children&mdash;Of the fact
itself there can be no doubt, as it is admitted by the Government
in its notification of the reduction of the city, though
it may be presumed that in the number there is exaggeration.'<a

<h2>APPENDIX 6<br />
LORD PALMERSTON'S ENQUIRY</h2>


<p>Lord Palmerston wrote to Sheil on May 2nd 1850:</p>

<p>'I have to instruct you to furnish me with a more detailed
account than that contained in your despatch No. 20, of the
12th of February, of the difference between the tenets of the
new sect of Bab, and those of the established religion of
Persia.'<a name="Nanchor_AVI1" id="Nanchor_AVI1"></a><a
href="#Note_AVI1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Sheil answered Lord Palmerston on June 21st:</p>

<p>'In conformity with Your Lordship's instructions I have
the honor to enclose an account of the new Sect of Bab&mdash;The
statement contained in the enclosure numbered No. 1
is taken from an account given to me by a disciple of Bab,
and which I have no doubt is correct. The other is extracted
from a letter from a chief Priest in Yezd, and cannot be
trusted&mdash;</p>

<p>'This is the simplest of religions. Its tenets are summed up
in materialism, communism, and the absolute indifference
of good and evil, and of all human actions.'<a name="Nanchor_AVI2" id="Nanchor_AVI2"></a><a
href="#Note_AVI2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately both accounts sent to Palmerston are highly
inaccurate. Moreover, Sheil's own comments indicate that
he himself did not have an open mind. Plainly the account
given to him, as he had stated, 'by a disciple of Bab', was
not a verbatim rendering into English, but a reconstruction
with interpolations, as witnessed by these two sentences:
'They believe in Mahomed as a Prophet and in the divine
origin of the Koran: but B&acirc;b contends that until this moment
only the apparent meaning of the Koran was understood
and that he has come to explain the real secret and divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
essence of God's word. But it will be seen in a subsequent
part of this account that the words <i>Prophet</i> and <i>Divine origin</i>
have no signification.' Further evidence is provided by
Sheil's rough notes with marginal additions<a name="Nanchor_AVI3"
id="Nanchor_AVI3"></a><a href="#Note_AVI3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> from which
the account by a B&aacute;b&iacute; is drawn.</p>

<p>What disciple of the B&aacute;b would say: 'The intercourse of
the sexes is very nearly promiscuous&mdash;There is no form of
marriage; a man and woman live together as long as they
please and no longer, and if another man desires to have
possession of that woman, it rests with her, not with the
man who has been her husband, if he can be so termed:&mdash;A
man may have wives without limit; a woman has a similar
licence.' This B&aacute;b&iacute;, unless his account was garnished, was
either a nihilist of sorts, or totally ignorant of what the
teaching of the B&aacute;b was.</p>

<p>Equally extraordinary, confused and contrary to the
Writings of the B&aacute;b in the Persian and Arabic <i>Bay&aacute;n</i> are the
following lines in that account by a B&aacute;b&iacute;: 'There is no hell
or heaven, therefore there is no hereafter&mdash;annihilation is
man's doom in fact&mdash;he with every living and vegetable
thing, in short everything whatever, will be absorbed in
the Divinity&mdash;Everything is God, and therefore <i>absorbed</i>,
which is the phrase of the Soofees, who consider every
thing is a reflection of God&mdash;Hell is suffered and heaven is
enjoyed in this world; but there is no such thing as crime,
nor of course virtue, only as they concern the relations of
man and man in this world. A man's will is his Law in all
things....</p>

<p>'The most absolute materialism seems to form the essence
of their belief&mdash;God is one&mdash;Every individual substance
and particle, living or not, is God, and the whole is God&mdash;and
every individual thing, always was, always is, and always
will be.'<a name="Nanchor_AVI4" id="Nanchor_AVI4"></a><a
href="#Note_AVI4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The account by the Chief Priest of Yazd, which was a
vitriolic attack on the B&aacute;b and Va&#7717;&iacute;d, and which Sheil had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
ruled out in his letter to the Foreign Secretary as 'cannot
be trusted', was not dissimilar, in some respects, to the
account by 'a disciple of Bab'.</p>

<p>These extracts make it clear how misinformed was Lord
Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary, by the reports
of his representative in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX 7<br />
MYTH-MAKING</h2>


<p>The volume of writing in the West about the B&aacute;b&iacute; and Bah&aacute;'&iacute;
Faiths is not insignificant. There are copious scholarly works
on the subject in Russian, French and English. We have
the works of Alexander Toumansky, Baron Rosen, M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Kazem-Beg, Count Gobineau, A.-L.-M. Nicolas, and Edward
Granville Browne. We also have attacks and refutations, but
these latter categories belong to more recent years, when the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith has been making considerable headway in the
Western world.</p>

<p>There is another genre of writing which merits attention,
if only for a negative reason. These writings do not enlighten;
they create myths. Generally speaking, remarks by
travellers and casual visitors to &Iacute;r&aacute;n fall within this category,
but are by no means confined to such writers.</p>

<p>A sizable book could be compiled of the remarks and
observations which are myth-making. Here we must be
content with only a few extracts. Some of these solemn
pronunciations are highly amusing, as with the following
which is taken from a book by Arthur Arnold:<a name="FNanchor_FZ_182" id="FNanchor_FZ_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_FZ_182" class="fnanchor">[FZ]</a></p>

<p>'The measure of injustice and oppression which these
courts of the Koran inflict upon the Christians may seem
mild, in comparison with the treatment by which they
suppress nonconformity within the pale of their own
community. We have seen an example in the sentence of
"a hundred sticks", which the incautious expression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
liberal views brought upon the friend of the Zil-i-Sultan
[&#7826;illu's-Sul&#7789;&aacute;n],<a name="FNanchor_GA_183" id="FNanchor_GA_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_GA_183" class="fnanchor">[GA]</a> who added to free speech the wickedness
of wearing trousers of European cut. There is, however,
in Ispahan a surviving heresy, the most notable in Persia,
which, when proved against a man, is almost a death
warrant.<a name="FNanchor_GB_184" id="FNanchor_GB_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_GB_184" class="fnanchor">[GB]</a></p>

<p>'Early in the present century, a boy was born at Shiraz,
the son of a grocer, whose name has not been preserved.
Arrived at manhood, this grocer's son expounded his idea
of a religion even more indulgent than that of Mahommed.
He is known by the name of B&#257;b (the gate), and his followers
are called B&#257;bis. In 1850, B&#257;b had established some reputation
as a prophet, and was surrounded by followers as ready
to shed their blood in his defence as any who formed the
body-guard of Mahommed in those early days at Medina,
when he had gained no fame in battle, and had not conceived
the plan of the Koran. B&#257;b was attacked as an enemy of God
and man, and at last taken prisoner by the Persian Government,
and sentenced to death. He was to be shot. Tied to a
stake in Tabriz, he confronted the firing party and awaited
death. The report of the muskets was heard, and B&#257;b felt
himself wounded, but at liberty. He was not seriously hurt,
and the bullets had cut the cord which bound him. Clouds
of smoke hung about the spot where he stood, and probably
he felt a gleam of hope that he might escape when he rushed
from the stake into a neighbouring guardhouse. He had
a great reputation, and very little was necessary to make
soldiers and people believe that his life had been spared by
a genuine miracle. Half the population of Persia would
perhaps have become B&#257;bis, had that guardhouse contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the entrance to a safe hiding place. But there was nothing of
the sort. The poor wretch was only a man, and the soldiers
saw he had no supernatural powers whatever. He was
dragged again to the firing place and killed. But dissent is not
to be suppressed by punishment, and of course B&#257;bism
did not die with him. Two years afterwards, when the present
Shah was enjoying his favourite sport, and was somewhat
in advance of his followers, three men rushed upon his
Majesty and wounded him in an attempted assassination.
The life of Nazr-ed-deen [N&aacute;&#7779;iri'd-D&iacute;n] Shah, Kajar, was
saved by his own quickness and by the arrival of his followers,
who made prisoners of the assassins. They declared
themselves B&#257;bis, and gloried in their attempt to avenge the
death of their leader and to propagate their doctrines by the
murder of the Shah. The baffled criminals were put to death
with the cruelty which the offences of this sect always meet
with. Lighted candles were inserted in slits cut in their living
bodies, and, after lingering long in agony, their tortured
frames were hewn in pieces with hatchets.</p>

<p>'In most countries, the theory of punishment is, that the
State, on behalf of the community, must take vengeance
upon the offender. But in Persia it is otherwise. There, in
accordance with the teaching of the Koran, the theory and
basis of punishment is, that the relations of the victim must
take revenge upon the actual or would-be murderers. In
conformity with this idea, the Shah's chamberlain executed
on his Majesty's behalf, and with his own hand, one of the
conspirators. Yet the B&#257;bis remain the terror and trouble of
the Government of Ispahan, where the sect is reputed to
number more followers than anywhere else in Persia. But
many of them have, in the present day, transferred their
allegiance from B&#257;b to Behar, a man who was lately, and
may be at present, imprisoned at Acca, in Arabia, by the
Turkish Government. Behar represents himself as God the
Father in human form, and declares that B&#257;b occupies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
same position, in regard to himself, that John the Baptist
held to Jesus Christ. We were assured that there were
respectable families in Ispahan who worship this imprisoned
fanatic, who endanger their property and their lives by a
secret devotion, which, if known, would bring them to
destitution, and probably to a cruel death.'<a name="Nanchor_AVII1"
id="Nanchor_AVII1"></a><a href="#Note_AVII1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our second extract is from a much weightier book written
by an American diplomat, Mr. S. G. W. Benjamin, the first
United States Minister accredited to &Iacute;r&aacute;n:<a name="FNanchor_GC_185" id="FNanchor_GC_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_GC_185" class="fnanchor">[GC]</a></p>

<p>'But the most remarkable sect now in Persia is probably
that of the B&acirc;bees, or followers of the B&acirc;b. Their importance
is not so much due to their numbers or political
influence, as to the fact that the sect is of recent origin,
full of proselyting zeal, and gaining converts every day in
all parts of Persia, and latterly also in Turkey. The B&acirc;bees
present one of the most important religious phenomena of
the age. It must be admitted, however, that they very
strongly resemble in their communistic views the doctrines
enounced [sic] by the famous Mazd&acirc;k [Mazdak], who was
executed by Chosroes I after bringing the empire to the
verge of destruction by the spread of his anarchical tenets.</p>

<p>'In 1810 was born Seyed Alee Mohammed, at Shir&acirc;z....
Like all the founders of oriental religions, he began his
career with a period of seclusion and meditation. He accepted
Mahomet and Alee in the creed which he considered himself
predestined to proclaim; but he added to this the declaration
that their spirits had in turn entered into his own soul,
and that he was therefore a great prophet,&mdash;the B&acirc;b, who
was to bring their gospel to a legitimate conclusion. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
became his mission, therefore, to announce that all things
were divine, and that he, the B&acirc;b, was the incarnate presentment
of the universal life. To this doctrine was added a
socialism which formulated the equality of all, sweeping
away social classes and distinctions, and ordaining a community
of property, and also, at first, of wives. The new
doctrines took hold of the heart of the masses; men and
women of all ranks hastened to proclaim their yearning for
something that promised to better their condition, by embracing
the wild teachings of the B&acirc;b ... the Government
could not long remain blind to the possible results if the
movement were allowed to spread unchecked. Therefore,
after several serious tumults, the B&acirc;b was seized and executed
at Tabreez. This only served to add fuel to the fire. A fierce
persecution broke forth; but the B&acirc;bees were not willing
to submit tamely to suppression.... The B&acirc;bees are now
obliged to practise their faith in secret, all of those in Persia
being outwardly of the She&auml;h sect. But their activity does
not cease, and their numbers are increasing rapidly. The
sect has also extended to Turkey. The leader of the Turkish
branch resides at Constantinople.</p>

<p>'In Persia the title of the present head of the sect is
Sob-e-Az&ecirc;l [&#7778;ub&#7717;-i-Azal]. As his belief in the B&acirc;b is a secret,
his name is not mentioned in this connection.... Just now
there seems to be unusual activity among the B&acirc;bees, emissaries
or missionaries are secretly pervading the country,
not only seeking to make proselytes but also presenting
modifications in belief. The community in wives is no
longer a practised tenet of the B&acirc;b sect, while it is proclaimed
with increasing emphasis that the B&acirc;b is none other
than God himself made manifest in the flesh.'<a name="Nanchor_AVII3"
id="Nanchor_AVII3"></a><a href="#Note_AVII3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next extract is by another diplomat, General Sir
Thomas Edward Gordon, who had once been the Military
Attach&eacute; and Oriental Secretary of Queen Victoria's Legation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n, and wrote his book after a second visit to
&Iacute;r&aacute;n:</p>

<p>'The Babi sect of Mohammedans, regarded as seceders
from Islam, but who assert their claim to be only the advocates
for Mohammedan Church reform, are at last better
understood and more leniently treated&mdash;certainly at Tehran.
They have long been persecuted and punished in the cruellest
fashion, even to torture and death, under the belief that they
were a dangerous body which aimed at the subversion of
the State as well as the Church. But better counsels now
prevail, to show that the time has come to cease from persecuting
these sectarians, who, at all events in the present
day, show no hostility to the Government; and the Government
has probably discovered the truth of the Babi saying,
that one martyr makes many proselytes....</p>

<p>'An acknowledged authority on the Bab, the founder of
this creed, has written that he "directed the thoughts and
hopes of his disciples to this world, not to an unseen world."
From this it was inferred he did not believe in a future
state, nor in anything beyond this life. Of course, among
the followers of a new faith, liberal and broad in its views,
continued fresh developments of belief must be expected;
and with reference to the idea that the Babis think not of a
hereafter, I was told that they believe in the reincarnation
of the soul, the good after death returning to life and
happiness, the bad to unhappiness. A Babi, in speaking
of individual pre-existence, said to me, "You believe in a
future state; why, then, should you not believe in a pre-existent
state? Eternity is without beginning and without
end." This idea of re-incarnation, generally affecting all
Babis, is, of course, an extension of the original belief
regarding the re-incarnation of the Bab, and the eighteen
disciple-prophets who compose the sacred college of the
sect....</p>

<p>'The Babi reform manifests an important advance upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
all previous modern Oriental systems in its treatment of
woman. Polygamy and concubinage are forbidden, the use
of the veil is discouraged, and the equality of the sexes is
so thoroughly recognised that one, at least, of the nineteen
sovereign prophets must always be a female. This is a return
to the position of woman in early Persia, of which Malcolm
speaks when he says that Quintus Curtius told of Alexander
not seating himself in the presence of Sisygambis till told to
do so by that matron, because it was not the custom in Persia
for sons to sit in presence of their mother.'<a name="Nanchor_AVII4"
id="Nanchor_AVII4"></a><a href="#Note_AVII4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It must be said that Sir Thomas Gordon's long account
of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s (from which only a few passages are taken) is
good in many respects; nevertheless, it perpetuates myths.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Finally, here are two extracts from a book<a name="FNanchor_GD_186" id="FNanchor_GD_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_GD_186" class="fnanchor">[GD]</a> so highly rated
that, when it was published in 1915, it was put on the 'Secret
List' of the British Foreign Office, and kept there for more
than a decade:</p>

<p>'A religious heresy which was destined to produce
serious political consequences in Persia made its appearance
during the later years of Muhammad Sh&#257;h: this was B&#257;bism,
the creed of the B&#257;bis or followers of the B&#257;b. The founder
was Saiyid `Ali Muhammad, the son of a grocer of Sh&#299;r&#257;z,
who, being sent as a youth to represent his father at B&#363;shehr,
soon left that place on pilgrimage to Makkah and afterwards
sat as a student at the feet of H&#257;ji Saiyid K&#257;zim, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
greatest Mujtahid of the day at Karbala. On the death of his
teacher he returned to B&#363;shehr, where he proclaimed himself
a prophet, the 23rd May 1844 being accounted the date
of his manifestation in that character.</p>

<p>'"He now assumed the title of the <i>B&#257;b</i>, or gate, through
whom knowledge of the Twelfth Imam Mahdi could alone
be attained. His pretensions undoubtedly became more
extravagant as time proceeded, and he successfully announced
himself as the Mahdi, as a re-incarnation of the
prophet, and as a Revelation or Incarnation of God himself."<a name="FNanchor_GE_187" id="FNanchor_GE_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_GE_187" class="fnanchor">[GE]</a>
The B&#257;bi faith was ecclesiastically proscribed
throughout Persia; and massacres of its adherents, with
counter-assassinations of leading persecutors, became the
order of the day.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'The new B&#257;bi religion in Persia, of which the institution
may be dated from 1844, the year in which M&#299;rza `Ali
Muhammad, commonly known as the B&#257;b, declared his
mission, does not appear to have obtained as yet much hold
on the coast of the Persian Gulf, notwithstanding that the
B&#257;b visited B&#363;shehr at an early stage in his public career.
It was reported that at B&#363;shehr there were in 1905 only about
50 B&#257;bis, chiefly employed in the Customs Department or
in the Artillery; a very few others were found at the ports
of Bandar `Abbas and Lingeh, and possibly at Shehr-i-V&#299;r&#257;n
in the L&#299;r&#257;vi district; but at Baghd&#257;d, which was
the headquarters of the B&#257;bi religion from 1853 to 1864,
it did not appear that there are any. It is probable, however,
that B&#257;bis are to be found in places where their existence
has not been ascertained.'<a name="Nanchor_AVII5" id="Nanchor_AVII5"></a><a

<p><a name="Footnote_BF_58" id="Footnote_BF_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BF_58"><span class="label">[BF]</span></a> Major Rawlinson nowhere mentions the name of the priest
who is alleged to have been the possessor of a 'spurious' version
of the Qur'&aacute;n. It is obvious that the priest, about whom he was
writing, could have been none other than Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;y-i-Bas&#7789;&aacute;m&iacute;,
whom he wrongly designated as 'Shirazee' for the simple reason
that he had come from <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z. His frequent references to the
disciples of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im as '<i>Us&uacute;l&iacute;</i>' indicate that his knowledge
of the issue was meagre, for these disciples were known as
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>&iacute;s. The term could have been more appropriately applied
to the opponents of Siyyid K&aacute;&#7827;im. They and their counterpart,
the 'A<span class="u">kh</span>b&aacute;r&iacute;s', followed different methods of interpretation
within the <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah fold. For a description of these schools of
thought, see Browne, <i>A Literary History of Persia</i>, Vol. IV, pp.
374-6.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_BH_60" id="Footnote_BH_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BH_60"><span class="label">[BH]</span></a> Rawlinson's letter to Sheil carries the statement that Mull&aacute;
`Al&iacute; abjured his faith. Apart from the evidence of the devotion
and heroism of the disciples of the B&aacute;b, which history amply
provides, several factors must be considered. Major Rawlinson
was not present at that meeting of the divines, which he termed
'the Court of Inquisition'. Therefore his information was secondhand.
The emergence of Sunn&iacute;-<span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;`ah antagonism was another
factor which would certainly have clouded the issue. The 'advent
of the Imam' need not, necessarily, have troubled the Sunn&iacute;
conscience, because Sunn&iacute;s have never believed in the Im&aacute;mate
and the occultation of the Twelfth Im&aacute;m. Furthermore, that which
Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; is supposed to have rejected, according to Rawlinson,
was a 'perverted copy of the Koran'. Would Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute; ever
have an interpolated copy of the Qur'&aacute;n to announce the message
he had to give, or to prove it? And then the question must also
be asked: if Mull&aacute; `Al&iacute;, the man who brought the news of the
advent of the B&aacute;b, had recanted, how was it that 'considerable
uneasiness' was becoming perceptible in Karbil&aacute; and Najaf, 'in
regard to the expected manifestation of the Imam'?</p></div>

It has always been assumed that he was put to death somewhere in
`Ir&aacute;q (either in Mosul or beyond), while being taken to Istanbul,
because nothing more was ever heard of him after he reached Mosul.
But recent research in official archives has established the fact that
he arrived in the Ottoman capital, was once again put on trial and
was condemned to hard labour in the dockyards, where he died
towards the end of 1846. (For most of this information the author

the questioning, he instructed, and the replies of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s

<p>
N&aacute;&#7779;iri'd-D&iacute;n <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h's language was abusive, but two points

he wanted to know what were the beliefs and intentions of the
'B&aacute;b&iacute;s'.

During the governorship of `Al&aacute;u'd-Dawlih, &Aacute;q&aacute; Najaf-`Al&iacute;,

Sir Henry Layard (1817-1894) was the discoverer of the
ancient city of Nineveh. He was elected to the British parliament
as a Liberal, and served a term as the Under-Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs. In 1877 he was appointed Ambassador in
Constantinople. His account is taken from <i>Early Adventures in
Persia, Susiana, and Babylonia</i>, Vol. I, pp. 257-61.</p>

The Ambassador recalled was Sir John MacNeill and the
quarrel between &Iacute;r&aacute;n and Britain was over the city of Hir&aacute;t.
This beautiful city had always been considered an integral part
of the province of <span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n, but since the assassination of
N&aacute;dir <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h, the Af<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;r king, in 1747, Hir&aacute;t had passed into
possession of Af<span class="u">gh</span>&aacute;n rulers. Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h was intent on
regaining &#7716;ir&aacute;t, but Anglo-Russian rivalry and the British fear
of Russian designs on India, hitherto almost non-existent, had
become dominant factors in the international scene, bound to
shadow the destiny of &Iacute;r&aacute;n; the British believed that the acquisition
of Hir&aacute;t by the Persians would, in the main, benefit Russia.
They took counter-measures in the Persian Gulf and occupied
the island of <span class="u">Kh</span>&aacute;rg, close to B&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span>ihr.</p>

<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> Mu&#7717;ammad was known as <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid, and also as

is attested by this verse in the Arabic <i>Bay&aacute;n</i>, one of the last
works of the B&aacute;b: 'Say O Mu&#7717;ammad, My teacher, do not beat
me ere my years have gone beyond five.'</p>

<p>His school was in the quarter called B&aacute;z&aacute;r-i-Mur<span class="u">gh</span> (Poultry
Market), housed in a mosque-like structure which went by the
name of Qahviy-i-Awl&iacute;y&aacute;'. It was close to the house of &#7716;&aacute;j&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; Siyyid `Al&iacute;, the uncle-guardian of the B&aacute;b. In its courtyard
were a number of graves: three were particularly revered as
those of saintly personages, one of whom was called Awl&iacute;y&aacute;'&mdash;though
no one really knew whose were the graves.</p>

<p>It is known that <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid wrote a monograph on the
childhood of the B&aacute;b, but the manuscript has always been in the
possession of people not well-disposed to the Faith of the B&aacute;b
and Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, and they have persistently refused to give it up
or to divulge its contents. <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> `&Aacute;bid was also destined in
later years to accept the Faith proclaimed by his former Pupil.</p>

By <span class="u">Dh</span>ikr, he means Himself. Repeatedly in the <i>Qayy&uacute;mu'l-Asm&aacute;'</i>,
the B&aacute;b refers to Himself as <span class="u">Dh</span>ikr, and was known to
His followers as <span class="u">Dh</span>ikru'll&aacute;h-al-A`&#7827;am (Mention of God, the

to the name of a Manifestation of God has been translated as 'His
Holiness'. But this English rendering is totally inadequate, for
'&#7716;a&#7693;rat' has no English equivalent when placed prior to the
name of a Manifestation of God. It conveys also the sense of
His Honour, His Eminence, His Excellency, and the like.</p>

[6]</span></a> Major-General Sir Henry Rawlinson (1810-95) was one
of the outstanding European figures in the nineteenth century.
It was he who transcribed the cuneiform inscriptions on the
rocks of B&iacute;sit&uacute;n in Western &Iacute;r&aacute;n, which record the achievements
of the great Darius. He discovered the key to decipher them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>Like Sir John Malcolm, he entered the service of the East India
Company at the age of seventeen. Six years later, he went with
two other British officers to train the Persian army, but after two
years he was dismissed because Mu&#7717;ammad <span class="u">Sh</span>&aacute;h had begun to
quarrel with the British. Next he served in Qandah&aacute;r. By his
own wish he was transferred to `Ir&aacute;q, because he wanted to be
close to Western &Iacute;r&aacute;n and continue his research. He also continued
the unfinished work of Layard at Nineveh. The British
Museum has a wealth of archaeological finds donated by him.
From 1859-60, he briefly occupied the post of British Minister
in &#7788;ihr&aacute;n. Then to the end of his life he served on the India Council
in London and devoted his time to writing and to scientific
pursuits. From 1870-84, the Trustees of the British Museum
issued four volumes of cuneiform inscriptions under his close
supervision.</p>

class="label">[14]</span></a> In 1970, the present writer received, through the good
offices of his cousin, Abu'l-Q&aacute;sim Afn&aacute;n, the photostatically-produced
copy of a manuscript describing this episode in B&aacute;b&iacute;
history. It is in the handwriting of &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-B&aacute;qir-i-&#7788;ihr&aacute;n&iacute;,
a merchant, whose brother, Mu<span class="u">sh</span>iru't-Tujj&aacute;r, was one
of the 'Five Martyrs' of S&aacute;r&iacute;. (These five were murdered in
the early years of the Constitutional Movement in Persia: see
Balyuzi, <i>Edward Granville Browne and the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith</i>.) &Aacute;q&aacute;
Mu&#7717;ammad-B&aacute;qir states, in a short introduction, that he visited
B&aacute;rfur&uacute;<span class="u">sh</span> sometime in the year 1319 A.H. (April 20th 1901-April
9th 1902), where he chanced upon a manuscript of the
history of the B&aacute;b&iacute;s at <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7788;abars&iacute;, written by one of them,
which he copied for himself and the benefit of others. He does
not mention the name of the owner of the original. This history
begins with an account of the author joining Mull&aacute; &#7716;usayn;
by this he can be identified, although he nowhere names himself.
There is no doubt that he was M&iacute;rz&aacute; Lu&#7789;f-`Al&iacute; or Lu&#7789;f-`Al&iacute;
M&iacute;rz&aacute; of <span class="u">Sh</span>&iacute;r&aacute;z, a descendant of the Af<span class="u">sh</span>&aacute;rid monarchs of the
18th century A.D. He was one of the few survivors of <span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span>
&#7788;abars&iacute;, who managed to escape in the company of Mull&aacute;
&#7778;&aacute;diq-i-Muqaddas-i-<span class="u">Kh</span>ur&aacute;s&aacute;n&iacute;, but in the holocaust of August
1852 (see Balyuzi, <i>Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h</i>, p. 18) he died a martyr's death.</p>

<p>On receiving and examining this chronicle, the present writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
recalled that E. G. Browne mentions, in his <i>Materials for the
Study of the B&aacute;b&iacute; Religion</i>, a manuscript history of the episode of
<span class="u">Sh</span>ay<span class="u">kh</span> &#7788;abars&iacute; by Lu&#7789;f-`Al&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;, sent to him by M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Mu&#7779;&#7789;af&aacute;, the Azal&iacute; scribe. As this manuscript is now in Cambridge
University Library, a photostatic reproduction was obtained
by the kindness of the Librarian. According to the scribe
(whose real name was Ism&aacute;`&iacute;l-i-&#7778;abb&aacute;<span class="u">gh</span>-i-Sidih&iacute;), the manuscript
which he copied for Prof. Browne was faulty, but he could find
no other for comparison.</p>

<p>Lu&#7789;f-`Al&iacute; M&iacute;rz&aacute;'s chronicle ends abruptly, and &Aacute;q&aacute; Mu&#7717;ammad-B&aacute;qir,
the copyist, incorrectly concludes that the author
must have died of starvation, since the last lines of his chronicle
describe the state of famine caused by the siege.</p>

<p>The present writer is currently engaged in collating the two
manuscripts.</p>

<h2>Transcriber's Notes:</h2>

<p>In this book, there are Footnotes (marked with letters) and
(end)Notes (marked with numbers). In the original book, the
footnotes are located at the bottom of the relevant pages and the
(end)notes are located at the end of the book (in its own section
titled "Notes"). In this e-book, the footnotes are relocated to
the end of the e-book (in a section titled "Footnotes",
after the Appendices and before the Bibliography.) It
is to be noted that some footnotes also contain (end)notes.</p>

<p>Obvious printer's errors have been repaired, other inconsistent
spellings have been kept, including inconsistent use of hyphen
(e.g. "above mentioned" and "above-mentioned"), diacritical marks
(e.g. "Shiraz" and "Sh&iacute;r&aacute;z"), and proper name (e.g.
"Zil.i.Sultan" and "Zil.e.Sultan").</p></div>
